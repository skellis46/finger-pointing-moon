# Justification of Resources: Finger Pointing Moon

>This statement should be used to justify the resources required to undertake the research project. You should:
• explain why the indicated resources are needed, taking account of the nature and complexity of the research proposed. Note that it is not sufficient merely to list what is required
• have regard for the breakdown of resources into the summary fund headings Directly Incurred, Directly Allocated and (where appropriate) Exceptions
• in some cases, such as investigator time, use of internal facilities and shared staff costs (all likely to be Directly Allocated costs), the basis of the costing need not be justified, but the need for the resources does need justification
• try to be explicit about the need for the level of investigator time sought, bearing in mind the complexity of the research, the need to manage the project and supervise staff and any wider considerations such as collaboration, research communication or facilities usage
• not justify estates and indirect costs
• include a clear and detailed justification for both why items expected to be found in a department (if sought) are required for the project and why they cannot be provided from the RO’s own resources (including funding from Indirect costs).
In drafting the Justification of Resources, you should ensure you identify which headings in the Summary of Resources the costs relate to, in order to make cross-referencing more transparent.

_Finger Pointing Moon_ is planned to maximise public engagement, accessibility and the PI's research and developmental goals in a cost-effective manner. Where possible, the project has planned online meetings and easily accessible conversations (e.g. micro-conferences on Zoom).

## Directly incurred staff

The PI Ellis (0.5FTE months 1-12, 0.8FTE months 13-18) will lead the project by managing the team and liaising closely with project partners. He will provide support to the RA and will be responsible for the project outcomes, development, public engagement and project impact.  

The level and volume of work warrants the support of a 0.5FTE Grade 7 Research Associate (RA) for the entire 18 months. A senior RA is requested as they will support the project through bibliographic research, drafting article outputs, event and output organisation, communications and data and website management.

## Directly incurred travel and subsistence

_Finger Pointing Moon_ is a research, development and engagement project with international project partners in the UK, Italy and Australia. The PI Ellis is based at CovUni but works out of London. 

There are two three-week periods of practice-research fieldwork that make up the central methodological component of the project. The field-based collaborative movement practice -- known as Authentic Movement -- requires expert input from two scholars, Whalley and Kneebone. Their fees are costed and justified below in _Directly incurred other costs_. The fieldwork will happen in London and return rail fare from Totnes to London (2 x £150 = £300), accommodation (6 weeks, £840 per week = £5040), and subsistence (42 days, £30 per day = £1260) is requested for expert Whalley. Fieldwork travel, accommodation and subsistence funds are not required/requested for expert Kneebone.

The exhibition, public engagement and impact work with project partner S'ALA in Sassari Italy requires three trips for Ellis. These trips are for the development of the exhibition output with the partner, and public engagement and impact discussions, workshops and events. We request return travel between London and Alghero (3 x £400 = £1200), airport transfers (6 x £50 = £300), and subsistence (20 days, £30 per day = £600). Accommodation in Sassari is provided by the project partner.

## Directly incurred other costs

The practice-research component of _Finger Pointing Moon_ requires expert collaborative input from two experts: Joanne 'Bob' Whalley and Roger Kneebone. Funds are requested for their fees: Whalley (6 weeks, £1000 per week = £6000) and Kneebone (2 weeks, £1000 per week = £2000). 

Specialist hardware is required for creatively documenting the practice-research fieldwork: two cameras (360º GoPro Max (£500) and GoPro Hero 9 (£500)), accessories (batteries, holders, cases, £500), 8 x SD cards for recording (£240), and one bus-powered hard drive for field-based data handling and storage (£400) -- see Data Management Plan. Professional-level audio equipment for field-recording and podcasting will be supplied by C-DaRE, the CovUni Research Centre. We request funds to transcribe recorded conversations from the fieldwork (20 hours at £100 per hour = £2000).

The development, engagement and impact components of _Finger Pointing Moon_ include exhibitions developed in collaboration with the project partners: S'ALA (Italy) and Dancehouse (Australia). The exhibitions have some costs in common and funds are requested for installation materials (£1500 per site = £3000), printing (£750 per site = £1500), and installation support (£1000 per site = £2000). These funds are necessary to ensure visually clear and engaging materials, that are robustly and safely installed. The exhibition _Unforgettable_ will be presented online, but we also request funds to create four offline versions of the materials to be sent to key dance organisations in the UK. We request money for printing and postage (4 x £500 = £2000)

The Australian output, engagement and impact work (_The Un/knowable Body_) has been developed to minimise travel and environmental costs while creating an innovative plan for collaborating with the project partner. The development and engagement strategy with the partner Dancehouse will involve a designated and highly experienced local artist-scholar Jason Maling (in communication with the PI) working closely with 6 local professional artists. They will work with the collated materials to develop a range of public events centred on the exhibition of the materials and a public conversation hosted by the PI via Zoom. We request £1500 to pay the local artist-scholar Maling (working with the PI to lead the other artists), and £1000 per artist (£6000) for their work towards the output. In the Italian iteration of _The Un/knowable Body_, the PI will work on-site with the Co-artistic Directors of S'ALA, Igor Urzelai and Moreno Solinas. We request funds to pay these self-employed artists for their involvement during two weeks of development (2 people for 2 weeks at £1500 per week = £6000)

The Australian and Italian versions of _The Un/knowable Body_ will also accumulate materials as the public and key stakeholders engage with the exhibition and associated events. To remember or 'mark' their involvement they will take a polaroid of their corporeal involvement in the materials. For this, we request funds for two Polaroid Now cameras (2 x £150 = £300) and Polaroid i-type film (50 packets of 8 slides, £15 each = £750).

The project has an important accessibility agenda (underpinned by significant and ongoing research at C-DaRE) as part of its public engagement strategy. For the text based materials (Outputs 3 and 4), we request funds for production and post-production of audio versions of the materials designed for visually-impaired audiences (£4000). These audio materials will be hosted on the project website. We also request funds (£1500) to produce closed captions for video recordings of the three micro-conferences (Output 10) for hearing-impaired audiences. The text-based materials for _The Un/knowable Body_ require translation into Italian, and we request funds to make this possible (£1000).

Funds are requested for production, advertising, hosting, support and transcription for 2 series of 8 episodes of the podcast output _The Point Beyond_ (£11400). This component of the project will be managed by Chris Garrington of Maltstore Communications Ltd/Research Podcasts. The Discourse Forum is a vital site for ongoing project public engagement and impact. Funds are requested to host the forum at CovUni for five years (£300 per year = £1500).

The RA will be recruited according to CovUni guidelines. We request £500 for the cost of that person's recruitment. 


### Notes 



## Edit bin

and environmentally sensitive This has involved minimising travel costs (particularly long haul international travel -- there are no flights in the project), and planning outputs such as the exhibitions that are easily transported and installed by local partners. 

Materials for the 3 practice-as-research processes (£6000) have been allocated to enable the PI and ARs to innovate with digital and analogue materials in their processes. Each of the three processes will also be supported by a basic film crew (consultants) (3 x £5000, total £15000), for a director of photography, light, set design, editor, sound recordist/design, and performers. This will ensure the practice-as-research outcomes are of the highest quality. These processes will also require unique spaces for filming (allocated at £400 per week for 8 weeks, total £3200). The four UK/Ireland exhibitions require technical support for installation and screening (£4000). 

Catering costs are requested for the interdisciplinary meetings (2 meetings x 20 people x £15 per person, £600), British Library impact event (60 people x £15 per person, £900), and for Symposium 1 at Coventry University (2 days x 40 people x £15 per person, £1200). Publicity printing (£500) and design work for the exhibitions and public outcomes (£1000) are requested to help communicate the research findings to the wider public. Interview transcriptions (150 hours at £25/hr, £3750) are required for the key interviews, interdisciplinary meetings, cross-disciplinary exchanges, and impact interviews. The transcriptions will facilitate analysis and dissemination.
