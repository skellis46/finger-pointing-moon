# justification of resources

>This statement should be used to justify the resources required to undertake the research project. You should:
• explain why the indicated resources are needed, taking account of the nature and complexity of the research proposed. Note that it is not sufficient merely to list what is required
• have regard for the breakdown of resources into the summary fund headings Directly Incurred, Directly Allocated and (where appropriate) Exceptions
• where costs incurred by international co-investigators are sought, a breakdown of these costs should be fully justified under a subheading of ‘International Co- Investigator Exceptions’
• in some cases, such as investigator time, use of internal facilities and shared staff costs (all likely to be Directly Allocated costs), the basis of the costing need not be justified, but the need for the resources does need justification
• try to be explicit about the need for the level of investigator time sought, bearing in mind the complexity of the research, the need to manage the project and supervise staff and any wider considerations such as collaboration, research communication or facilities usage
• not justify estates and indirect costs
• include a clear and detailed justification for both why items expected to be found in a department (if sought) are required for the project and why they cannot be provided from the RO’s own resources (including funding from Indirect costs).
In drafting the Justification of Resources, you should ensure you identify which headings in the Summary of Resources the costs relate to, in order to make cross-referencing more transparent.

### Justification of costs

_Finger Pointing Moon_ is planned to maximise public engagement, accessibility and the PI's research and developmental goals in a cost effective and environmentally sensitive manner. This has involved minimising travel costs (particularly international travel -- there are no flights in the project), and planning outputs such as the exhibitions that are easily transported and installed by local partners. Where possible, the project has also been planned to involve online meetings and openly accessible conversations (e.g. micro-conferences).


expert input (from Amy: and it is in minute amounts (this is a fellowship after all) AHRC will not be too rattled; and more important that you can clearly justify the necessary need. They are not going to be ‘employed’ but rather can only be ‘helicoptored’ in and out swiftly for brief moments.) -- Bob Whalley
