To Whom It May Concern

We welcome this opportunity to write as a project partner in support of Simon Ellis's AHRC Research, Development and Engagement bid -- _Finger Pointing Moon_ -- and to express our commitment to the project. 

S'ALA is a regional organisation in Sassari, Italy that serves local, national and international contemporary arts communities. The organisation has three components: _S'ALA Spazio per artist*_ -- a large physical home; _S'ALA Produzione_ -- a cultural organisation with regional public funding that offers artistic residencies and presents finished works and works-in-progress by Sardinian, Italian and international companies; and _S’ALA Formazione_ -- which organises dance and theatre courses and workshops.

These three components make S'ALA unique in the city of Sassari and the region of Sardinia. The proposal _Finger Pointing Moon_ represents a remarkable opportunity for S'ALA to combine the three branches of our organisation in order to develop a long-term public engagement strategy here in Sassari.

_clearly explain the value, relevance and possible benefits of the work to the project partner_

Focus on building a community of artists -- local, national and international -- and audiences for those communities. Focus on the body. Given the nature of the project, which has to do with the multiplicity of understandings of the body, I would imagine that we can involve as many people as possible

The collaboration with Ellis will 


Workshops: 20 people comfortably, 3 workshops, community nature means this group will likely change across the workshops. 

2 days long. community -- mix of professional artists, but also people with jobs in other worlds. Make as open as posssible. Free of charge. week with ellis before 1st, week with ellis after 3rd -- leading to opening of exhibition.

Long-term, we imagine this research partnership with Simon Ellis will create new conversations about the body at a local level, and which we will explore ways to continue beyond the _The Un/knowable Body_  exhibition itself. 

_nature and equivalent value of any in-kind contribution, and/or declare the value of a cash contribution, and period of support_


(Il corpo s/conoscibile)

exhibition: in large atrium of S'ALA, for up to 6 months. A 'live' exhibition whereby we add to it as a practice, and invite visitors and audiences to also add (something simple like photos of their bodies)
public conversation
Public exhibition/output: the length depends on where it will be installed. If it was installed in a common area (entrance/corridor/atrium of S’ALA) it could stay up for days/weeks/months. If it was installed in of the working spaces it would need to be shorter (a week max?). Simon, do you imagine this exhibition could comfortably exist on walls? Public conversation super welcome. Not sure about how to document, open to suggestions.

It would be important to reach the right people in order for the effects to be long lasting: university? Liceo coreutico? Local dance/theatre teachers and students?

_added value to the project of the project partner’s involvement. This is particularly important regarding public engagement. What strategies might we use to directly engage audiences (and how are they specifically relevant to the planned exhibition)? Who are those audiences?_

## plan

1. initial collection phase of materials (Finger Pointing Moon team)
2. work with S'ALA (project partner and key stakeholder) to identify participants for workshop series. Open to all.
3. workshop 1 S'ALA: initial explorations with materials, processes of translation (from texts to bodies, from English to Italian), ways of representing this process, work with participants to identify strategies for public engagement, initial evaluation (basic data, recorded conversations and written reflections)
4. workshop 2 S'ALA: deepening understanding and translation of the collected materials, test methods for public engagement, second evaluation (recorded conversations and written reflections)
5. workshop 3 S'ALA: generating public outcome building on work in first two workshops, third project evaluation
6. public exhibition/output S'ALA: how long installed? how documented? Include public conversation?
7. Impact evaluation (+6 months)

Two strands of beneficiary:
- workshop participants (involved in development, public engagement, production)
- exhibition/output viewer or participant

purposes:
- to inspire and inform people about how much and how little we know about the moving body
- to build relationships with project partners and users and beneficiaries

outcomes:
- increased understanding
- enjoyment
- skills development
- inspiration and creativity
- new experiences
- learning

What kinds of benefits/impacts?
- increased skills and cultural awareness of role of body in navigating and understanding experience (change in capacity, knowledge, understanding, attitude or awareness)
- long-term??
