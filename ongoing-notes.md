## 20191126 - museum of things that fall through the gaps

>In Barthes’ thinking, the writerly sits as opposite to the readerly. It includes the non-lisible, which cannot be read, into the system. It is a utopia in Barthes’ political drive to give space to what cannot be read. For Barthes, that which cannot be read is in the act of writing, where meaning is suspended and where the text does not lie (yet) in the realm of interpretation and ideology. 

- From Emilie Gallier.
- thinking here about my Museum of Dance and other things in the gaps. Fallen through the gaps. Things that don't fit. Museum of dance and other things that don't fit.
- that Barthes is describing (inadvertantly) such a space.

## 20191114 - maps, gaps and the non-archive

Remembering dance and other things in the gaps
See surveillance book about maps. Think of creating. Non-map. Anti-map. A place for things that don't fit on maps. Or think in relation to archives? Anti-archive. Non-archive.
