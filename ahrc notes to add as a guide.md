## Research methods

>Why have you chosen these methods? Why are they the best way to answer the research questions or problems you have identified? 

>Depending on the approach you are using throughout your research, you may also need to explain clearly the creative and/or performative aspects of the work, explain how you will develop a new process, product or tool, or provide details of who you have consulted or will be involved in the process of research.

## Project management

>How will the project be managed? What will be the roles of the members of staff involved (including you and, if applicable, any research assistants)? What is the timetable for the project? Does it include appropriate milestones and is it realistic? When will the outputs of the project be completed? How will you ensure that they meet the needs of your audience? Can the costs be justified? How will you ensure good value for money? The project management section should also include the management of the digital and data management aspects of the projects, if applicable, and should be coordinated with the information in the Data Management Plan. It should be clear what the milestones for the completion of this element and the work should be incorporated into the timetable for the whole project. The project management of the data management aspects of the project should include an assessment of risk in relation to the complexity and delivery of the project.
You should describe fully the arrangements for supervising and managing the research assistant. If the researcher is unknown you should state the skills and qualifications sought. Similarly, if the project involves a visit to or a secondment from a member of staff from another organisation, you must state clearly what work they will pursue and describe the working relationships envisaged with other members of the team.
In terms of supporting the research staff funded on the project, you should clearly outline the development opportunities which the project will make available. These should include opportunities both in relation to research expertise, and wider opportunities, for example, in connection with the activities proposed in the Pathways to Impact statement.

>The AHRC is one of the signatories of the RCUK Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers. More information about the Concordat and what it entails can be found here: [ukri.org/files/legacy/skills/review-tor-concordat/](https://www.ukri.org/files/legacy/skills/review-tor-concordat/)

## Development Plan

>This section of the Case for Support should include details of your proposed development activities, and an explanation as to why these activities are appropriate to helping you enhance capabilities as research specialists in your field. You should make clear how these activities enhance the transformational potential of the research and its broader influence and importance. Please refer to the Enhancing Research Capabilities in section 1.5 for further details on what is requirement for this section.(p.73)

>In framing your proposal, you will need to clearly articulate a set of activities and to demonstrate both how they will enhance your role within your field, and how they significantly develop your research and its broader influence and importance.(p.26)

>The activities outlined, which should be commensurate with your current career stage and trajectory, should go beyond the kinds of activities that researchers generally undertake in establishing themselves in their disciplines or in the ordinary course of their duties. In other words, the Fellowship offers the opportunity to be innovative in the types of activity which might be taken forward and allows Fellows to explore new avenues. Fellowship proposals should include a substantial programme of collaborative activities and you should be bold in thinking about what is needed to support them.

>When applying to this scheme, fellows will be required to articulate a set of development activities, to demonstrate how they will enhance their profile or status within their field, and how they will develop their research and its broader influence and importance.(p.101 Guide 4.9)

>-to develop capabilities as research specialists and to create opportunities for outreach beyond their research field;
>-to undertake innovative and collaborative development activities, including the initiation of new research, which will result in benefits for their own discipline(s) and beyond.

>How are these all researcher-development activities?

## Outputs, Dissemination and Impact

>The Outputs, Dissemination and Impact section is your opportunity to describe in more detail how the potential impacts of the research will be realised. Information under this heading should build on details given in the Summary and Academic Beneficiaries sections of the Je-S form whilst also elaborating further on other areas of the Case for Support. You should address two main questions: who might benefit from the research and how might they benefit?

>Taking into account what is reasonable and appropriate given the nature of the research you propose to conduct, please provide examples of how the proposed research will be managed to engage any users and beneficiaries that have been identified, or to identify potential users and beneficiaries as the research progresses, and to increase the likelihood of achieving impacts. In presenting your plans, you should tailor and target your dissemination activities to ensure that they are relevant to the specific user and beneficiary groups likely to be interested in your research and appropriate for supporting the potential research impacts outlined.

>You should consider (and address if appropriate) methods for communications and engagement, collaboration and development. You should also detail who will be undertaking any dissemination activities and include any resource implications in the financial summary and in the separate Justification of Resources attachment. Please also explain further how the research will benefit other researchers in the field and – where relevant – academic beneficiaries in other disciplines.

>It is your responsibility to justify the value and appropriateness of the output(s) and outcomes in the Case for Support.

>You are encouraged to disseminate your research and its outcomes to as wide an audience as possible, and where appropriate to engage in communication, dissemination and exploitation activities throughout the period of the project. You should therefore specify the audiences to whom your research could be of interest, and how you propose to engage with those audiences about your research.
