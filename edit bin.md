-- these are the ways in which practice-research represents its understandings or findings while keeping them at arm's length
-- other than just methodology or what to call practice-research -- 

The history of practice-research has been shaped by relativist and constructivist approaches to making epistemic claims. 

That is, what is peculiar to the concept of know-how in artistic practice-research as compared with, for example, engineering or bioethics?

not an abstract or theoretical line interesting only to epistemologists. Rather, it is 

In 1992 the UK Higher Education Funding Councils first recognised the work of artists as research and, given the potential "access to highly lucrative government funding",[@magee_introduction._2012 n.p.] art and artists became invested in the production of knowledge. Since then, the epistemological project in practice-research has comprised various attempts to reverse-engineer art-making through an epistemological lens. That is, once art was recognised as research it became necessary to justify and validate its knowledge-producing bona fides, and to avoid a situation in which "the entire history of art [became] eligible for a postgraduate research degree."[@frayling_research_1993 p.5] Nevertheless, 

[^theory]: Practice-research has a history of referring to theory, not to oppose, confront or build theoretical understandings, but to prop up the academic status of the artistic work.**add citation** 

Useful here from Schwab: 

>The social dimension of experimentation stems from the agreement that has to be reached whereby a particular something resulting from the experimental system is, in fact, matter-of-fact. This something as matter-of-fact does not strictly speaking exist before such (public) negotiation, making an epistemic thing not only a piece of knowledge but also an ‘artefact of communication’ (Shapin 1984, 484).[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.123]

_Finger Pointing Moon_ is a set of research, development and engagement collaborations. The collaborations with the project partners are key to the impact and public engagement activities, and how niche ideas about epistemology in artistic-scholarly practice matter, and how they are able to be communicated and spread through professional and artistic communities (within and outside of the Academy).

>Your Fellowship project can be up to 18 months (min at 0.5FTE max at 1.0FTE) but the research assistance can be up to a total 12 months of full time distributed over the 18-month period.
In other words, RA can work up to the maximum at (12/18) FTE for 18 months or 1.0 FTE for 12 months.

The following are examples of possible ways of formulating a proposal; they are for illustrative purposes only:
• You could request 6-12 months at 100% time with researcher development activities integrated for the duration of the funded time.
• You could request funding for 12 months for concentrated research activities at 100% FTE, followed by 6 months at 20% time to conduct researcher development activities building on this research.
• You could request 6 months at 100% time for skillset activities followed by 12 months at 40% time continuing the research alongside researcher development activities.(p.28 Funding Guide)

- split between research activities (outputs) and developmental ones, and the possibility of managing this throughout the 18 months

- balance of research and development activities throughout the 18 months. recognising that they go hand in hand. ??

employing "unconditional positive regard"[@rogers_necessary_1957]

- check that I am clear that the design is only part PaR. See zettel <art practice and artistic research.md> -- also, only part is really what Bob and I will do (including outcomes). That PaR is then applied ... (check through, with and in). The art practice is both the object of the research, and will also be one of the research outcomes.

**Is the practice in AHRC contributing to that discourse (around the body/AM/etc) or solely in service of PaR?** See for example <art practice and artistic research.md> in slip box. I have a feeling the AM is serving two masters. More importantly, what do I want it to do? Frayling's in, for and through useful here? 


>As Schwab thinks through the relationship between artistic research and contemporary art he proposes that we must move away from objects (not clear what he means by objects) with a "more or less stable historical identity"[@schwab_experimental_2019 p.166] to "more precarious, ambivalent, or provisional things."[@schwab_experimental_2019 p.166] -- support for use of AM?

add something from Bob here about limited knowledges?

Skills as an artist-scholar ...
The ‘job in hand’ gives a further and complex insight into enquiries of bodies, and what lies in between / beneath / behind. The artist scholar is charged with the doing, (un)doing, of something. Some of the skills pertinent to the task ...
Ways of reading
Ways of understanding 
Ways of bodies
Temporary understandings
Understandings in flux
Embedded / entwined and limited knowledges. 

This ‘limited’ nature is an area of perhaps enhancement to artistic-scholarly practice (in yours, and others). Not in terms of filling the gaps, or as presaged understanding, but of what can be forgotten. So a different route to delimiting knowledge.

- to address the idea that practice-research's place is an epistemic place (and not to stay within realm of techne). to know something differently. to know-that. this is not to reduce or displace know-how or craft. ties to Rheinberger and building epistemic things.
- but what is the nature of this epistemic place? can something that is unknowable (akin to Berry's thinking) except through direct experience (ref from obsidian) be an epistemic thing? And if not, what kind of _thing_ is it? 
- some kind of line between what is observable and standpoint epistemology

**Noë writes that in art and philosophy "there aren’t breakthroughs or discoveries or results or findings in these fields, certainly not ones that invalidate or cancel out earlier ones or preclude future ones."[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 11, n.p.] Rather, what we have is more about change, history and evolution; "moves in an important conversation"[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 11, n.p.] that keep that conversation alive and open. Art and philosophy do not produce "stand-alone nuggets of truth"[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 11, n.p.] but are akin to a score which we enact as much as we perceive:**

>We start out not seeing what is there. But by looking and interrogating and challenging, we come to see it. The work challenges us to reorganize our seeing, our expectations, and our thinking. The work of art, like that of philosophy, is the reorganization of ourselves. And this reorganization, this work, aims also at understanding.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 11, n.p.]

**Noë is stating that the value and function of art is not about discovery, but in understanding. We are changed by it.** -- and therefore, the communication of changes becomes vital to the epistemological project in any research, but particularly PaR and in particular (even more) body-based.

**The question becomes then who is changed by it -- and sets up the possibility of [[a case for writing in practice-research]] in which the artist-researcher sometimes does that work of change, other times allows it to rest with the audience/viewer. In this respect it's not so much the presence of writing that confers the status of 'research' on a work of art, but rather that the researcher has done the work of communicating change/understanding (which will not be equivalent to the understandings afforded by the artistic artefact)**

#### The intrinsic-extrinsic debate

The project of creating epistemic justifications for practice-research has been characterised by a continuum bookended by two conflicting positions:[^40k] 1) artistic artefacts require a written statement that synthesises the epistemic status (findings) of the research;[e.g. @noauthor_ref2021_2019; @nelson_practice_2013] 2) artistic artefacts themselves contain and communicate research findings.[e.g. @borgdorff_conflict_2012] 

[^40k]: For example, note the contradiction in the UK that a practice-research PhD normally requires approximately 40k words of contextual writing, while a submission to the Research Excellence Framework only requires a 300 word summary statement. 

Both positions have inherent problems. The extrinsic position -- that knowledge in practice-research is only revealed or clarified through written contextualisation[@bolt_magic_2007; @smith_practice-led_2009; @candy_role_2011] -- limits the importance of the artefact,[@magee_introduction._2012; @borgdorff_debate_2006; @candlin_proper_2000] and sets few if any margins on the epistemic claims that artistic-scholars make on behalf of their practices. Such claims are rarely "made available for sustained and verifiable peer review".[@haseman_tightrope_2007 n.p.; see also @candy_role_2011] 

The intrinsic position -- that knowledge is intrinsic to or "embodied in"[@borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.vi] artistic-research artefacts[@ellis_that_2018; @borgdorff_conflict_2012] -- positions ambiguity and uncertainty as epistemic virtues that produce "less identifiable knowledge products."[@butt_performance_2014 p.114]. Such products act as points of epistemic resistance: they "resist academic conventions of accountability"[@borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.ix] or "ways of knowing that are not able to shape -- or be shaped by -- the various tools and systems of the knowledge economy."[@ellis_that_2018 p.490]  

The tension between intrinsic and extrinsic _claims to knowledge_ in practice-research looms over practical and theoretical work in the field.[e.g. @borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.ix] It is a conflict founded on: i) the extent to which scholars and regulatory bodies _believe_ that language is needed to describe and justify claims to knowledge;[e.g. @berry_life_2001; @williams_mindfulness_2012] ii) differing perspectives on the limits of artistic practice outcomes to _hold_ and communicate understanding;[e.g. @stephen_scrivener_art_2002; @borgdorff_debate_2006] and iii) the contested relationship between artistic-scholarly outcomes and the pursuit of truth.[e.g. @nelson_practice_2013; @noe_strange_2015; @ingold_search_2018] 

In _Finger Pointing Moon_ the intrinsic-extrinsic conflict likewise looms over the project's methods, analysis and outcomes. The conflict is the historical epistemic air that the project breathes. 

Consequently, artist-scholars have an open secret: we often conceive our research findings _a priori_ and/or present them _a posteriori_ as reflective spaces[@jeremy_bubb_missing_2020] using vague and hopeful language.

>actions are not meaningful in isolation. The performance of isolated actions results in a loss of coherence and in dissatisfaction.[@biggs_communities_2011 p.89]

Biggs and Buchler [@biggs_communities_2011 p.95] very interesting in relation to accumulation of knowledge vs singularity of event

>... they see that language is only a finger pointing at the moon and not the moon itself.[@johnston_cloud_2012 p.2]

>Some aspects of the world may be within the limits of our thought but beyond the limits of our knowledge; faced with competing descriptions of them, we cannot know which description is true. Some aspects of the world may even be beyond the limits of our thought, so that we cannot form intelligible descriptions of them, let alone know that a particular description is true.[@markie_rationalism_2017 n.p.]

- key question for me here is how do non-academics benefit from this work? this is probably why that practice for theatre exhibitions is useful. It gets back to the Snowden thing.

Yet the often-asked and simply stated question -- _How do we know that we know what we know?_ -- reveals niche-ness is valuable way beyond specific academic concerns. The question _ underpins the impact of project's outputs. 

It will be an attempt to do this with humility, and to see the experimenter-researcher as "engaged in an activity that has, 'a life of its own.'" without the "tyranny of the subject."[@rheinberger_forming_2013 p.199]

>This also means getting rid of the age-old thinking about Erkenntnistheorie as being about an I, an ego, a subject that tries to cast a theoretical net over an object. Instead, let us be a little bit more humble and see the experimenting subject as engaged in an activity that has, to put it in Ian Hacking’s (1983,150) words, "a life of its own," and one that is in need of many good eyes to see and many good ears to hear. Let us get rid of what could be called the tyranny of the subject.[Rheinberger in @rheinberger_forming_2013 p.199]

Perhaps these conditions are axioms?

>In developing these criteria we too are making assumptions about what research is. However, our method is not circular, but axiomatic. Axiomatic argumentation proceeds from a few unverifiable statements that lie outside the system of argumentation, paradigmatically employed by Euclid (2000). One axiom that we have identified in our own approach is that we assume research is a cumulative process.[@biggs_eight_2008 p.8]

>Axioms are discretionary and it is important for the transparency of academic argumentation that the ones that are adopted be identified from the start because, aside from their inef- fability, i.e. they are not explained by the researcher who adopts them and cannot be explained within their system of thought, being discretionary means that it is equally valid to adopt a different axiom.[@biggs_eight_2008 p.8]

or what  Therefore, this programme of communications-based activities builds on Biggs and Büchler's "Situated Position"

At  is the clear tension ... niche, specific, specialised. Developmental part is all about communications. To bridge gap between the specificity (nicheness) of the research and my skillset as a communicator to audiences beyond the specifics

1) to extend expertise ... new research areas -- development of deliberate shift towards empirical possibilities of par. To attempt to research and articulate some edges or limitations in par. New line of enquiry in PaR. 

The plan is that this development plan will help develop and change the way "whole communities of people relate"[@bendell_leadership_2019 n.p.] and that these changes will be sustained over time. 

What I hope to do is create strategies for communicating the value of something that appears to have little value outside of a small sub-group of academics. This would have two (rather obvious) components: a) understanding what that value is; b) attempting to communicate it to people inside and outside the Academy.

The development plan in _Finger Pointing Moon_ has two key components: i) collective action and ii) enhanced community-based communications. Both components ..

solitude practice
- providing intellectual leadership
- inspiring creativity in other researchers


These collective (and collecting) practices will be contrasted by a speculative _wildcard_ practice of one hour per day in solitude and silence. This is a method to dwell in uncertainty and the limits of understanding, because "doubts, or questions, or even just difficulties ... can only be found within -- without distractions, without peer pressure, in solitude".[@deresiewicz_solitude_2010] 


The types of activity that individuals may wish to pursue will vary greatly from field to field, and depending on career stage, but might include the following:
1. fostering wider impact from your research;
2. developing emerging research areas, methods or approaches;
3. providing intellectual leadership.
4. fostering interdisciplinary research involving your field;

• encouraging new research collaborations and partnerships;
• inspiring creativity in other researchers;
• shaping research agendas;

Enhancing research capabilities include:
1. developing new methodologies, or introducing emerging techniques, technologies or methodologies into your field; (empirical work)
2. leading research networks (online discourse forum -- relates to 3 below as well)
3. supporting or inspiring the development of other researchers in your field 
4. establishing new lines of enquiry -- focus on empirical? 

>Leadership actions are those that help shift the way groups, networks or whole communities of people relate and so such actions generate effects over time. [@bendell_leadership_2019]

about fetishizing process:
Add list here incling J. of Embodied Research, JAR, and any version of REF. Not surprising because mostly artist-scholars are artists who end up in the university and just want to get to do their practice. The 'market' of journals is simply responding to the desires of artist-scholars


##### Equivalence

Knudsen has suggested that "knowledge is knowledge"[@knudsen_research_2016 n.p.] even though it might be generated in distinct ways. Similarly, Pakes has written that unless we can know an artist's claim to knowledge, artistic research can not have "equivalent status with other, more traditional forms of scholarly enquiry".[@pakes_knowing_2009 p.10] This focus on epistemic equivalence is more about justifying the presence of practice-research in the Academy than it is about the epistemic nature of practice-research. 


The lack of limits is not surprising given practice-research's emergence from experimental qualitative research at the height of post-modern philosophical thinking. Likewise, the field's disregard for research's relationship to truth i

Mention Ingold here about truth. What can be said? What can't be said? What are the edges? The failures? How might the language of practice-research be radically re-shaped?  


In this presentation about the nature of research in art, anthropologist Tim Ingold discusses the value of seeking truth. He describes research as being "aspirational" in its pursuit of truth, and that truth in itself is "absolutely not objective fact".[@ingold_search_2018 np] He says:

>Truth is the unison of imagination and experience  [...] Truth requires that we take ourselves into the world. We can’t remain outside of it.

>There is danger in conflating truth and objectivity. It is the search for truth that underpins research. Search and search again. Research is continually conducted in the dark.

I'm drawn to this idea of how he values the search, and how integrity -- or perhaps rigor -- in research comes from grappling with the materials and their possibilities, not from finding _a truth_.
 
I wonder though what other kinds of truths exist. 

Even in clear disagreement Borgdorff and Scrivener pushed the practice-research epistemic question towards the intrinsic end of the intrinsic-extrinsic continuum, and in doing so pulled the audience into the conflict. 

by _noticing change_ I mean acquiring knowledge or observing ways in which "our seeing, our expectations, and our thinking"[@noe_strange_2015, Chapter 11, n.p.] are reorganised;

write this following paragraph as lead in to next section.
Borgdorff states that artistic research is concerned with knowledge embodied in artistic objects and processes.[@borgdorff_debate_2006] His summary is that the "distinctive character of art knowledge" is cognitive and rational, though non-conceptual and non-discursive.[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.15] 

He suggests that practice-research's 

- borgdorff (debate, 2006) -- good overview
>The epistemological issue of the distinctive character of art knowledge is also addressed by phenomenology, by hermeneutics and by the cognitive sciences.[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.14]

Mention (for each) how they might touch on the extrinsic-intrinsic continuum

>In sum, the knowledge embodied in art, which has been variously analysed as tacit, practical knowledge, as ‘knowing-how’ and as sensory knowledge, is cognitive, though nonconceptual; and it is rational, though nondiscursive. The distinctive nature of the knowledge content has been analysed in depth in phenomenology, hermeneutics and cognitive psychology.[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.15]

>With what kind of knowledge and understanding does research in the arts concern itself? And how does that knowledge relate to more conventional forms of scholarly knowledge? The short answer to the first question is: knowledge embodied in art practices (objects, processes). The answer to the second question will provide a closer understanding of what ‘embodied knowledge’ may be.[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.13]


In research instances where an artist-scholar's understanding of their know-how is changed through artistic-research then  

Use of the term exposition by Schwab and JAR. e.g. "Michael Schwab from the Royal College of Art in London for coining the term ‘exposition’ for this form of writing. Exposing practice as research amounts to assembling material—images, sounds, texts, artefacts— which together make a case, a claim, whereby the balance between words and other articulations may vary."[@borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.x]


>Any added discursive outcome is there to support, not replace, the artistic contribution the research claims to make.[@borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.vi]

"the three defining questions of epistemology"[@markie_rationalism_2017 n.p.]
- what is nature of knowledge?
- how do we gain it?
- what are the limits? 

To date, no research has directly examined the margins and intersections of these two positions in practice-research. 
The aim of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is to use a range of methods -- name them -- to examine the margins and intersections of intrinsic and extrinsic epistemics in body-based practice. 

I will use a range of methods -- empirical practice-research fieldwork, lived experience as a dance artist-researcher, personal communications, interviews with key thinkers-practitioners and supplemental scholarly research -- to examine the margins and intersections the intrinsic-extrinsic tension will percolate throughout the methods, analysis and outcomes.  

**What is missing from this section? Need to address proxies, limits and hyper-specificity in “other research” section?**

It reveals itself in common questions like, what work can the artistic work do?; what is the role of the writing in my practice? Do artistic artefacts communicate underis the relationship between the writing and the practice?  

Intrinsic and extrinsic epistemic positions also explicitly fail to recognise that research processes in all disciplines adopt the most suitable methods to recognise change or difference in the materials or data of those processes. When artist-scholars adopt practice-research methods it is therefore _implied_ but rarely stated that these methods are best able to reveal change and difference in the artistic materials, experiences and practices that underpin the research. Yet what types of changes or differences are _really_ made possible by practice-research and how are they able to be recognised if at all? 

artists just do practice-research because they are artists and p-r is what artists do in the university. **add here "When body-based practitioners ..."** add note about the method is often simply assumed -- I'm an artist, I therefore do practice-research. 

- early efforts: Pakes (know-how) Scrivener (apprehension)

Whereas in the early stages of the development of practice-research there was considerable focus on its epistemic underpinnings, since 2011 this scholarship has all but disappeared. At the same time there has been a sharp rise in scholarship using the ill-defined term _embodied knowledge_ (and its cousin _tacit knowledge_) as a concept to describe the epistemic value of (body-based) practice-research.[^ek1] 


The intrinsic position is particularly vulnerable to the development of epistemic proxies that stand in for the epistemic complexity, nuances and possibilities of practice-research. For example, in much practice-research, there has been a sharp rise in scholarship using the ill-defined term _embodied knowledge_ (and its cousin _tacit knowledge_) as a concept to describe the epistemic value of that research.[^ek1] Artist-scholars who research through movement practices have valorised and reified the concept of embodied knowledge; as if to say, the body knows and _ipso facto_ practice-research generates knowledge. An epistemic proxy does not address the epistemic complexity and limitations of practice-research, and keeps genuine changes in understanding at arm's length. Add point here about documentation being the critical proxy in practice-research (and connect to digital technologies? surveillance). This is because "proxies are easier to manipulate than the complicated reality they represent".[@oneil_weapons_2016 Chapter 3] -- related also to maps and territory, e.g. [lesswrong.com/s/5g5TkQTe9rmPS5vvM/p/RcZCwxFiZzE6X7nsv](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5g5TkQTe9rmPS5vvM/p/RcZCwxFiZzE6X7nsv)


- make clear that so much focus of practice-research has been on techne (know-how). Have argued previously that this is a given in any research practice: the capacity to do something, to have the know-how. But this is not the interests of any research method (or ought not to be). Example of science: know-how to filter chemical or run a regression. (unless process changes: development of epistemic thing)

>New knowledge generated by research, whether practice-based or not, is expected to have two characteristics: first that it is shared and second that it can be verified or challenged.[@candy_role_2010 p.121]


>This is how art has, on the one hand, got on the books as research these last twenty-five years, albeit by way of the artist-researcher’s exegetical accompaniment, with all sorts of pernicious effects on the artwork actually produced for the exercise and largely withdrawn from judgement in the process. It is also why there is so little love for the thing.[@magee_introduction._2012 n.p.]

In the early 2000s scholars attempted to make epistemic sense of practice-research through the standard account of knowledge as justified, true, belief, and through its relationship to phronetic know-how.[] Since then, 

>as Biggs argues, the artwork, and hence, the apprehensions, only exist within a context (Biggs 2003). The artwork alone, without text, cannot be seen as a research outcome.[@candy_role_2010 p.125]

>Practice-based art research can be about the creation of new apprehensions but any art object made as part of that research does not, by itself, embody knowledge. However, the text that accompanies the work may indeed illuminate new apprehensions or a new way of creating apprehensions that we can claim as the new knowledge produced.[@candy_role_2010 p.121]

- project website


To generate a flexible set of epistemic principles able to be used across disciplines and practices is a bold aim. It is also an aim that is founded on two seemingly paradoxical values that underpin the nature of leadership: authority and humility. In other words, _who_ has the authority to know, and _how_ might humility act to attenuate such authority? In _Finger Pointing Moon_ I will scrutinise the nature of authority in leadership by working with the radically analogue nature of the human body to examine _who_ gets to know, and _how_ they get to know. The project will be built on first-person research methods to deepen our understanding of two broad areas: creative practice-research, and leadership.

2. To interrogate leadership as a practice of humility, and examine how practices of humility, patience and listening play a role in construction of knowledge. 

- to understand leadership as a practice of humility  
- to build leadership as humility into understanding _who, when and why_ is constructing knowledge 
- focus on collective organising; strategies for collective organising: collecting practice? (this is the bit about 'people' from Bendell)
- leadership/practice connected by corporeal actions: what the body can do, and what the body does (fare: to make and to do)
- examine through practice the role of solitude in understanding leadership, action and change (contrast this with 'group epistemics' from That Thing Produced – actually, not in contrast. I think they sit together quite clearly. (see [@sennett_together_2012 p.21] -- about getting outside yourself)

But _Finger Pointing Moon_ is also a project in which the possibilities and limitations of leadership are built into the research design. It is a project _about_ leadership -- "a word to describe significant _actions_ enabling _change_ that is welcomed by affected _people_."[@bendell_leadership_2019] The concept and potential status of leadership is not a funding-led _container_ to bolster my claims to be a practice-research disciplinary leader. Rather, the overarching design is built around leadership that involves _actions_, _change_ and _people_. 

- add something here (or in paragraph after) about these three things (actions, change, people) - something about Bendell's thinking is about responding to the climate crisis. 

>"Epistemic things are the unknown, or vaguely known, objects of investigation that are the counterparts of experimental conditions (the technical objects). They do not simply yield in docile fashion to the technologies of investigation" (Mody and Lynch 2010, 3; see also Rheinberger 1997, 30-31). [@gramelsberger_laboratory_2013 p.104]

### Three underpinning epistemic problems in practice-research

#### 2 The Problem of What Can and Cannot Be Known

Practice-research has a long and important history with ambiguity. The _ways of knowing_ as represented by artistic artefacts inevitably involve messy and productive uncertainty; that when we are doing practice-research we are lost in the "mangle of practice".[@pickering_mangle_1995] This is the suggestion -- sometimes implicit, other times explicit -- that the epistemic essence of practice-research has only the _potential_ for meaning and understanding as a feature.[@ellis_that_2018] In other words, the epistemic work of artistic-research artefacts is to set in motion the possibility of understanding, the possibility of apprehension, the possibility of knowing differently. There are strong and important reasons for valuing research that pedals ambiguity. At the same time, there has been little if any concerted effort to recognise and/or articulate the epistemic limitations of practice-research: what are the things, experiences and sensations that cannot be known, understood or articulated? Between these two situations -- the ambiguity and messiness of what _might_ be known differently and what is not able to be known differently through practice-research lies the second problem underpinning _Finger Pointing Moon_. This second problem is the key epistemic paradox of creative practice-research: that its nature lies at least in part in what is _not_ able to be known, understood or articulated as a consequence of creative practices. **add here to specify in relation to body-based.** This is a humbling limitation for any research method or process. But it is also a limitation that is vital to examine and articulate in order to prevent _anything being possible or conceived of as 'knowledge'_ in practice-research. In order to understand what can be known and articulated through practice-research, we must attempt to understand what cannot. [which invites big big question about most appropriate or plausible method to deal with this question]

That artist-scholars who research through movement practices are failing to address the profound experiential changes and differences generated through practice, while valorising and reifying the concept of embodied knowledge; as if to say, the body knows and _ipso facto_ practice-research generates knowledge. 

using a thing to recognise changes in that thing.
changes in a cell wall — while also being the cell wall
inside and outside - feeling and felt - taster and tasted - 

think through this.
had to do with habits -- the capacity to notice change from first-person perspective. but even in somatics it's founded on support of external person. hence value of the observer in authentic movement.
- do I need a third-person perspective in the room? what about an anthropologist? or sociologist? someone trained in observation? 

we are not just inside and outside, we are inside something as it undergoing change. 
how do we experience change when it is happening to us? how do we apprehend difference (difference limen)? like frogs in water being heated up. or the air that we breathe.

#### 3. The Problem of Specificity

Generalisability is a key aspect of positivist research methods. That if we know _this thing or state_ about one (smaller) population or sample we can generalise that same thing or state to another (larger) population. Generalisability provides limited but vital powers of prediction. The opposite of generalisability is specificity. For example, in medical research specificity is generated by the power of case-studies. **Ginot's examination of this in somatics is useful here**. If a single case of a medical condition exists then it not able to tell us anything about a population, but it does tell us that this problem exists and that it is probable that it will exist in other people. 

Practice-research projects are, by and large, a series of hyper-specific case-studies. Each practice-research project is in effect a single case-study that is able to say only certain limited things about the experiences, practices and understandings in that specific project. At its best such specificity affords clarity, nuance and understanding. At its worst it creates insularity: a series of research bubbles that rarely touch each other, rarely talk to each other, and rarely even know of each other's existence. Research, by definition, involves critical and open dialogue with other similar or overlapping practices. The problem of specificity in practice-research is that its various ideas, methodological practices and understandings (or 'findings') are rarely if ever in open and critical dialogue with each other, and that this is possibly inevitable given the overly specific nature of individual research projects. A potential alternative to mitigate the problem of specificity in practice-research is to develop sets of epistemic principles and values that facilitate critical dialogues across projects and disciplines. (focus on language here -- like emotion wheel) 
- Batson[@batson_body_2014 p.8] mentions ungeneralizable nature of somatics experience

#### 1. The Problem of Proxies

- it's possible that the aim of this part is about understanding and revealing the proxies implicit (and specific) to PaR, and offering alternatives, or strategies for recognising, or strategies for acknowledging. But proxy of embodied knowledge (closely related to know-how) is perhaps the biggest of them all. 
- they are also efficient (like maps and territory), and useful. But need to be questioned

Is embodied knowledge the only proxy I can think of? Are there others? That this is just an example of one -- that is peculiar to body-based practice-research? actually, "knowledge" is the real proxy. we generate knowledge. we are knowledge producers! I'd say "process" is a proxy as well. Also "video evidence". What other 'fingers' are there pointing at the moon? Berry suggests language is also such a proxy: <human experience and language.md>. We forget that they are proxies (akin to Heidegger's enframing, and relationship to Borgmann's _focal things_

The complexities -- and sometimes impossibilities -- of articulating what is understood differently through practice-research may have created another distinct problem. Whereas in the early stages of the development of practice-research there was considerable focus on its epistemic underpinnings,[^under] since 2011 this scholarship has all but disappeared. At the same time there has been a sharp rise in scholarship using the ill-defined term _embodied knowledge_ (and its cousin _tacit knowledge_) as a concept to describe the epistemic value of (body-based) practice-research.[^ek1] Could it be that these two phenomena are related: that in the place of scholarship directly exploring the epistemics of practice-research, artist-scholars have replaced it with a proxy? That artist-scholars who research through movement practices are failing to address the profound experiential changes and differences generated through practice, while valorising and reifying the concept of embodied knowledge; as if to say, the body knows and _ipso facto_ practice-research generates knowledge. An epistemic proxy does not address the epistemic complexity of practice-research, but rather what can be understood differently through practice-research is kept at arm's length. After all, "proxies are easier to manipulate than the complicated reality they represent".[@oneil_weapons_2016 Chapter 3] In _Finger Pointing Moon_ I seek to understand the extent to which the proxy of embodied knowledge is blinding artist-scholars to the _reality_ of the underlying limits and possibilities of body-based practice-research. Without epistemic clarity, practice-research's value as an approach to understanding the ambiguous, messy and complex experiences of human artistic endeavour are diminished. **You hint at value here. I think you need something upfront on value/impact/importance etc.**

[^ek1]: e.g Midgelow [-@midgelow_introduction_2019]; 

I will use body-based practice as a research lens because they represent an edge-case of the epistemic limits and possibilities of practice-research: they 

In this research I propose to use body-based practice-research as a lens through which to critically examine the diverse collection of methods that comprise practice-research. 

_Finger Pointing Moon_ examines what we can come to know or understand differently through body-based practice-research. 


>The distinction may not perfectly map onto the distinction between knowledge-how and knowledge-that, especially if Aristotle is taken at his word that what distinguishes epistêmê is what it is knowledge of: what “cannot be otherwise than it is” (Nic. Eth. 1139b.20). 

>epistêmê in Aristotle's strict sense: scientific knowledge of what cannot be otherwise than it is -- what is necessarily so.[@fantl_knowledge_2012]

>For Ryle, then, to know how to do something is to be disposed to behave in certain ways, and it's going to be very hard to specify in advance what those ways are. It will depend on the situation and on what the goals of the knower are.[@fantl_knowledge_2012]

-- points to my research know-how but not knowing specifically those ways. To be adaptive. 

The tension between intrinsic and extrinsic epistemics is felt most sharply in body-focused practice-research like dance and somatics. Body-based practices acutely feel the tension between intrinsic and extrinsic ways of knowing ... Therefore, body-based practices = ideal vehicle. 

Curiously, both intrinsic and extrinsic positions are often inadvertently supported in journals devoted to practice-research. This is the case when the _contextual writing_ refers to the epistemic ambiguity of the artistic artefact and the desire to let the art work do the work.

e.g. the writing refers to the ambiguity and letting the work do the work More common is simply to describe a research process (see JAR V20 - and lift any number of quotes from <reflections on JAR.md>)

"writing and theorisation surrounding the artwork [are] crucial to its fulfilling all the functions of research"[@smith_practice-led_2009 p.7]

If it is "the search for truth that underpins research"[@ingold_search_2018] then, even under the conditions in which "truth is aspirational",[@ingold_search_2018] practice-research's relaxed attitude towards falsifiability (and the truth) is a serious problem. Hence, the diverse range of outcomes artist-scholars state as research _findings_ are often at best conceived _a priori_, or at worst simply made up. 

this is because it hasn't yet happened built on assumptions and proxies.
it's important because currently we generate unfalsifiable outcomes in which anyone can say anything, and that are rarely explicitly built on or around other overlapping practices. But what do we get or gain from something different? 

- is anything not able to be claimed? is anything not 'presentable as truth'? what are the limits? at what point would a reader guffaw? (reminded here of that experiemnt to get fake papers published)

We have situation where most practice-research is about sharing what happened (or what they did). Circulations of process. Fetishization of process (e.g. REF -- pick your year). JER does this for sure -- except it's process that has been videoed. 

that this systemic failure has complex ramifications for artist-scholars working with body-based practices, and as such these practices 

In body-based practices like dance and somatics, the four characteristics above are uniquely amplified. These are practices predicated on the movements, gestures, postures and stillnesses of bodies, and where those same bodies underpin the development of new understandings. For such practices, 

The underpinning practices are diverse, distinct and often presented as singular or one-off projects. 

variously known as practice-research, practice-led research, artistic research, practice-based research and practice-as-research. It is 

_Finger Pointing Moon_ is predicated on two propositions: i) that there is a systemic failure in practice-research to even attempt to address the changes and differences made possible through research-focused artistic practices; ii) 

-- and the historically tenuous footing of practice-research inside the Academy -- 

In _Finger pointing moon_ body-based practice-research will function as a case-study through which to examine and understand three underpinning epistemic problems **Why are these problems? These problems are more aimed at body-based, not practice-research in general** in practice-research to do with 'new knowledge' or 'new understandings': 1) The problem of the proxy; 2) The problem of what can and cannot be known; 3) The problem of specificity. These 

delimit to body-based. but make an aim to consider relationship to practice-research generally.
- delimited to body-based practice-research as methodological strategy. 

Langer's thinking about experience without symbolic mediation is pretty important here: <without symbolic mediation.md>: 

>It may seem strange that the most immediate experiences in our lives should be the least recognized, but there is a reason for this apparent paradox, and the reason is precisely their immediacy. They pass unrecorded because they are known without any symbolic mediation, and therefore without conceptual form. -- Susanne Langer, Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling, Vol. 1, 1967.

>You should describe the research context for your project/programme of work. Why is it important that these questions or issues are explored? What other research is being or has been conducted in this area? What contribution will your project make to improving, enhancing, or developing creativity, insights, knowledge or understanding in the chosen field of study? To whom will the outcomes of your research be of particular interest?

There has been no systematic research directly examining ... 

This has particularly been the case in practices that are predicated on the limits and possibilities of the human body.

- got me thinking about the danger in this project of going so far out (ie requiring such a wide-angle) in understanding principles of properties that they become useless. that it is specificity that is utterly critical to practice-research. 
- good reason to delimit to body-based ... 

- general problem in practice-research
- body-based as paradigmatic example of complexity of problem
- generate claims/principles that speak directly to body-based
- such claims may be useful or appropriate to practice-research generally but cannot know this. My desire yes. but can't be sure. if the principles and values are so zoomed out then they might become useless. specificity is a key principle -- could use this as example. (Galloway's lists)
- no desire to create another 'overarching' method like Nelson

I seek to understand the extent to which the proxy of embodied knowledge is blinding artist-scholars to the _reality_ of the underlying limits and possibilities of body-based practice-research. Without epistemic clarity, practice-research's value are diminished.

This line of inquiry has fallen away or disappeared and it is not clear why. In more embodied creative practices (like dance, performance, live-art), the concept of _embodied knowledge_ has emerged as a form of epistemic proxy or red herring, 

. But even if it is correct to suggest that the 'body knows' (whatever this might mean), such a statement sheds little if any light on understanding the effects of working with and through practice-research. Therefore, the epistemic limits and possibilities of practice-research remain profoundly unclear. 

There is an epistemic crisis in body-based practice-research. In much of that research, the idea that the body _knows_ acts as a proxy for the epistemic limitations of practice-research investigations. In other words, 

Need to ask this as a question. That is -- not something I already think/believe. Recognise that embody is a term used loosely (can draw on definitions here), but analysis of how it is used, and potentially what is not being said. This is a kind of 'meta' or high-level approach.

>Have we somehow conspired to arrange matters so that knowledge is always what we say about something rather than what we show about it? [@biggs_editorial_2002]

By addressing these problems I aim to produce epistemic values and principles for body-based practice-research (but might be able to be extended beyond )

The contemporary cultural backdrop for the tension between embodied knowledge, the unknowable, and the inarticulable is the datafication of human experience. In 2017 _The Economist_ declared that the "world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data". We live in the age of _surveillance capitalism_ that is founded on "extractive operations in which our personal experiences are scraped and packaged as the means to others’ ends". The cultural and financial capital of understanding the world-as-data means it is not surprising that precarious and delicate artistic practices and processes located in and through the body – like dance and somatics – have also become enamoured by the doctrine of datafication. The rapidly growing number of online archives, digital forms of documentation, and virtual and augmented reality projects are all implicit or explicit attempts by dance scholars to transform the radically analogue nature of embodied experiences into data. 

is underpinned by these two phenomena: the limitations of embodied practice-research, and the datafication of experience. These phenomena are related because the construction and production of knowledge in any scholarly field is never based on the simple and objective observation of worldly phenomena. Rather, to understand what we say we know and do not know, the vital epistemic question is in fact "who, when, [and] why is constructing knowledges?" If the overwhelming contemporary phenomenon is the extraction of data from human experiences, then the question of _who, when and why is constructing knowledges_ necessitates an encounter with the limits and excesses of datafication. 

In this project, I propose that complex and radically analogue human experiences like experimental choreographic and movement practices have ontologies that are underpinned by two key characteristics: a) they defy the capacity to be accurately and wholly articulated and shared; and b) they exceed "algorithmic description".[@odell_how_2019] _Finger Pointing Moon_ is positioned squarely at the intersection of the datafication of human experience and the limitations of embodied practice-research. 

_Finger Pointing Moon_ is a project designed around creative practices that resist datafication, understanding and articulation, and the overarching purpose of the design is to create the conditions in which to develop an original set of practice-research epistemic principles (and also set of values). How does this aim relate to datafication? More like it's something to push against -- that it acts as a 'measure' of utility and function. That if something resists that process, it reveals things about the nature of that _something_. This makes the concept of datafication a methodological (and conceptual/theoretical?) strategy. A kind of thought experiment.
