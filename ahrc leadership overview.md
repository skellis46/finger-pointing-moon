Aims
The Leadership Fellows Scheme is designed to develop and promote research leaders â€“ individuals who set research agendas, lead research communities, provide intellectual leadership in their own disciplines and beyond, have a transformative impact on their subject area, and also act as advocates for the value and benefits of arts and humanities research to publics beyond academia. The Scheme offers opportunities for researchers and their research organisations to work in partnership with the AHRC in strengthening leadership capacity and capabilities in the arts and humanities.
The aims of the Leadership Fellows Scheme are to provide time and support for researchers:
- to develop their capabilities as research leaders.
- to carry out excellent individual research which has the potential to generate a transformative impact on their discipline, and which is of exceptional intellectual scope and importance;
- to develop and undertake innovative and collaborative leadership activities which are connected to their research and which will result in benefits for their own discipline(s) and beyond

- 6-18 months
- 50 and 250k
- 50-100% of my normal time (if over 12 months some most be part of my normal time)
- keep it at 50% (makes me available to do other stuff)

>A proposal submitted to the Fellowships scheme must outline both the activities that will enable you to develop and take forward research leadership and the individual research that will be undertaken. Your proposal will be assessed on both the leadership and research activities which you propose for the Fellowship.
>you will need to clearly articulate a set of research leadership activities which demonstrate how you will develop or enhance your leadership role, and make clear how these activities enhance the transformational potential of your research and its broader influence and importance.

foster wider impact from your research
	- e.g. building the wicked problem into other research agendas
	- recognising limit of that which is countable
develop emerging research areas, methods or approaches
	- traditionally we have focused on what can be seen, but what if we use occuolocentric tools to focus on that which cannot be seen?
	- building an epistemology of practice
	- methods and outcomes through the visual but what is not there
foster interdisciplinary research in your field
	- epistemologies of the south
	- critical race theory / black studies / 
	- visibility / invisibility
be creative and inspire creativity in other researchers
	- continue pushing alternative methods of representation
	- exploring alternative methods for dialogue / sharing

>leadership activities proposed should go beyond the kinds of activities that researchers generally undertake in establishing themselves in their disciplines, or in the ordinary course of their duties.

- working with other groups, bodies, organisations
- research assistance possible, but not Co-Is
