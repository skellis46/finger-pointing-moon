# head of department statement

## The statement

[from p.69 of August 2020 AHRC guidelines]

>The Head of Department Statement should be a maximum of two sides of A4. All letters should be signed, dated and on headed paper. It should be attached to the Je-S proposal by the approver/submitter at the Research Organisation rather than by the applicant.

>Naming convention: [PI Surname]_HoD

>A statement is required from the Head of Department or other relevant Senior Manager for Research, Development and Engagement Fellowship applications 

>The Head of Department should briefly outline the process by which they have identified you to be a research leader, or potential future research leader, suitable to apply for a Fellowship. It should outline previous institutional support for you and detail the programme of career enhancing support that will be undertaken during and after the Fellowship period. The support should be appropriate to your career stage and nature of your research but could include, for example, various combinations of:

>-allocation of a place on a career enhancing programme or other training and development support aimed at developing capabilities as research specialists;  
>-significant additional support for research time/sabbaticals to enable the Fellow to enhance their research career;  
>-awarding of institutional research development funding to support development of the applicant’s research profile;  
>-creation of research groups or development of departmental/institutional research strategies in relation to the applicant’s research area;  
>-supporting knowledge exchange or partnership activities involving the applicant, or providing a platform for the Fellow to take part in high profile public engagement activities;  
>-support for networking activities, inter-disciplinary or international collaborations;  
>-provision of specialist technical support for the Fellow’s research and/or to sustain its legacy;  
>-nominations for high profile prizes, awards or positions in the field.  

>The statement should indicate how the individual’s needs have been identified and supported, and should distinguish between generic support available for development available in the institution, and specific support for you that has been, and will be provided.

>The provision of institutional support is an important assessment criterion under this scheme. Poorly supported applications may not be accepted and any that are assessed as merely meeting minimum requirements are unlikely to be funded.

>If you are committing less than 100 per cent of your normal contracted working time to the Fellowship, the Head of Department should outline any teaching, examining and administrative commitments that will continue alongside the award. Fellows must be released from duties for the time specified and must not be expected to take on additional work within the institution once an award has started.

## Research Organisation commitment

[from p.30 of AHRC guidelines]

>The provision of strong, active institutional support is an important criterion under the scheme and the Research Organisation should outline as clearly as possible the specific support that it has provided, and will provide, in supporting your individual career and leadership development. This information should be provided in the Head of Department statement attachment and should distinguish between generic support available in the institution, and specific support that has been, and will be provided.

>This statement also needs to include details of how you will be relieved from existing duties in order to fulfil the time commitment of the Fellowship, and how any teaching duties related to sustaining your research area (e.g. specialist subject modules) will be delivered while your time is allocated to the Fellowship.

>The Research Organisation will need to demonstrate that it has been highly selective in the proposals submitted and provide evidence of commitment to your career and research development before, during and after the proposed Fellowship.

>In the event that you move institution, transfer of the award would be subject to provision of an institutional support statement by the new Research Organisation outlining at least equivalent support for the Fellowship and your subsequent career development. As the amount of time to be dedicated to the Fellowship is a known amount, your salary costs should be recorded as a Directly Incurred cost.

>The extent to which the proposed Fellowship would fit within relevant institutional/departmental research, career development and knowledge exchange strategies, as appropriate.
