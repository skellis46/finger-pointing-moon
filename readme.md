# readme

This is the readme file for the _finger-pointing-moon_ git repo.

_Finger-Pointing-Moon_ is the working title for a dance and performance research project examining the epistemology of dance practice.

The materials in this repo are the primary part of the preparation and design of an Arts and Humanities Research Council Leadership funding bid. I have made the repo public in order to make it possible for any git user to watch, fork, or use the data and writing in any way they see fit. Although the use of this writing by others is unlikely -- in part because most academics in the Arts and Humanities are not familiar with git technologies -- I sense that writing and editing in open and accessible spaces is vital in imagining new ways to share ideas and processes, and in expressing humility in relation to the idea of _original thoughts_. 

Feel free to contact me on skiptime@pm.me if you have any questions.
