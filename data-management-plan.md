# Data Management Plan

>The Data Management Plan should outline the project’s approach to managing data. It is mandatory to include for all Leadership Fellows, Research, Development and Engagement Fellowship scheme, Research Grants and Follow on Funding applications but is not required for Research Networking. 

>1. Briefly introduce the types of data the research will create. Why did you decide to use these data types?

>2. Give details on the proposed methodologies that will be used to create the data. Advise how the project team selected will be suitable for the data/digital aspects of the work, including details of how the institution’s data support teams may need to support the project

>3. How will the data be stored in the short term?

>a. What backup will you have in the in-project period to ensure no data is lost?

>4. How the data will be stored in the long term
    >a. Where have you decided to store it, why is this appropriate?
    >b. How long will it be stored for and why?
    >c. Costs of storage – why are these appropriate? Costs related to long term storage will be permitted providing these are fully justified and relate to the project Full justification must be provided in Justification of Resources (JoR)

>5. How the data will be shared and the value it will have to others
    >a. How the data will enhance the area and how it could be used in the future?
    >b. Releasing the data – advise when you will be releasing and justify if not releasing in line with AHRC guidelines of a minimum of three years. If the data will have value to different audiences, how these groups will be informed?
    >c. Will the data need to be updated? Include future plans for updating if this is the case.
    >d. Will the data be open or will you charge for it? Justify if charging to access the data
    >e. Financial requirements of sharing – include full justification in the JoR

>6. Ethical and Legal considerations
    >a. Any legal and ethical considerations of collecting the data
    >b. Legal and ethical considerations around releasing and storing the data – anonymity of any participants, following promises made to participants

## 1. Data types

The fieldwork will be documented to produce still images, video images and spherical 360º video. The still images will be captured with a GoPro Hero 9 as RAW files (5000x4000 pixels, 300dpi in .gpr and .jpg format), and the video images using the HEVC codec (H.265) at 4k and 60fps. HEVC is a modern codec that maximises image quality while keeping file sizes relatively small. The Hero 9 will make still and moving image production as seamless as possible while the researchers are moving, and the file formats created will provide the most flexibility for post-production and output. Spherical 360º video (.360 format) will be captured with a GoPro Max at 6K resolution and stitched to 5.6K Equal Area Cubemaps (EAC) split into two separate video tracks (H.264). We will use GoPro Player for Desktop to decode both streams and re-project into a sphere ready for .mp4 output. The 360º video will enable rich documentation of the movement practices, and in particular the constantly shifting spatial relationships between the two researchers. 

Audio data will be created for the podcast (Output 8), and for providing audio materials for visually impaired audiences for the exhibitions (Outputs 3 and 4). Both sets of data will be recorded as high-resolution 16 bit .wav files at 320kbps, 44.1kHz, and then compressed to 64kbps mono .mp3 files. This is the commonly used format and compression for speech-based podcasts, and will ensure maximum flexibility and accessibility for online production and presentation.

The video essay (Output 7) will combine a range of text, audio and video materials that are recorded as a "desktop documentary" with screen recording software Screenflow. It will produce a high-definition 1080p .mp4 video (H.264 codec). This will ensure the file is easily able to be stored, uploaded and shared. 

The curated "micro-conferences" (Output 10) will be recorded Zoom conversations that produce .mp4, .m4a audio, and .txt chat data streams. These formats are ideal for any post-production required, and small enough to be easily embedded in the project website.

All video data produced for the project will be uploaded to the C-DaRE Vimeo channel as H.264 mp4 files, 25fps, 10,000kbps, 1920x1080 (with audio: AAC-LC, 320 kbps, 48 kHz). Vimeo uses the H.264/AVC codec, an international ISO/ITU standard, and the most used codec for distributing HD video. We will use Vimeo to maximise accessibility and cross platform/device use. Video content will also be permanently and securely stored and backed up via the Coventry University institutional repository.

The project website (Output 11) will be securely hosted and served by Coventry University using the WordPress content management system. WordPress enables maximum design flexibility with industry standard responsive designs. The RA and PI will develop and maintain the site for the length of the project. The content will include project details, a project blog, project outputs, and video embeds (from Vimeo) of materials produced during the project. 

All written materials for the project will be created using markdown text files (.md). This format creates small file sizes and ensures complete future proofing. These text/written materials (including the development of this proposal) will be publicly available through Coventry University’s enterprise version of GitHub. Currently, the project proposal (including this case for support) is publicly hosted on a cloud version of GitHub at https://github.com/skellis46/finger-pointing-moon. These data will be transferred to the University-hosted enterprise version of GitHub at the start of the project. 

## 2. Methods to create data

The practice-research fieldwork will comprise a series of experiments using the movement practice known as Authentic Movement. Two researchers (Ellis (PI) and Whalley (expert input)) will work with recording technologies that do not interfere with their movement yet provide high quality moving and still image data. The key will be to generate a range of rich video materials on which to create experimental document strategies. The PI Ellis has been working with analogue and digital video technologies, image production, storage and post-production and internet-based technologies for 25 years. He will be responsible for planning and executing the data and digital aspects of the work. He will be supported when necessary by CovUni's IT services team, particularly with hosting the Wordpress site and Discourse Forum.

## 3. Short-term data storage 

During the fieldwork, all video, photographic, audio, and text data will be transferred from SD cards to an encrypted and password-protected portable hard drive. At the end of each working day, these data will be uploaded to the CovUni project Sharepoint site (see long-term data storage).

## 4. Long-term data storage

All video, photographic, audio, and text data will be uploaded and stored in an encrypted Microsoft Sharepoint file repository set up specifically for the project by Coventry University, and hosted on their servers. The repository is fully secure and GDPR compliant. The storage is mirrored to a secure ISO27001 off-campus site and subject to a Disaster Recovery Plan. Secure nightly backups are taken. This store will be for the multi-media project data and only authorised people will have access to these data. Coventry University Information Technology Service has processes in place to ensure: the completeness and accuracy of the backed-up data; backup copies of data are stored in a secure manner; data can be restored from a required backup within a reasonable time with authorisation from a data custodian; control of media rotation; secure storage; copies of data are taken on schedule; the secure disposal of data and magnetic media when they are no longer required. There is no storage space limitation for the project and the data will be stored until five years after the end of the project. The costs of data storage will be absorbed by CovUni.

## 5. Sharing and value to others

Coventry University's institutional repository will be the default location for the Open Access dataset. _Finger Pointing Moon_'s multiple Open Access digital outputs will be embedded in the project website. These various multi-media data will be released as they are produced in accordance with the project timeline (within 18 months of the project start date). Audiences will be informed through the project website, and by newsletters and social media posts through project partners, C-DaRE and CovUni. These data will act as an example of an unconventionally open and freely available dataset for other practice-researchers nationally and internationally. In addition, the transparent process -- along with the CC-BY data which will be publicly accessible -- will ensure the project's claims are subject to comprehensive scrutiny. The data will not need to be updated, and the costs of storage and sharing have been absorbed by CovUni.    

## 6. Ethical and Legal considerations

All ethical and legal considerations will be clearly established from the start of the project. The artist-researchers involved in the research component of the project (PI Ellis, and experts Whalley and Kneebone) understand the nature of their involvement and are aware they will not be anonymous in the data collected during fieldwork. That is, they will be able to be identified through the audio-visual data presented in the experimental documentation. This is a normal ethical situation for practice-research. Nevertheless, Whalley and Kneebone will be required to provide consent to develop and work with their data sets, and for dissemination of the research outputs. They will be informed they are free to withhold their consent and will be asked to approve any material prior to it being made public. If required, the PI will anonymise their involvement. No information beyond that which identifies Whalley and Kneebone within their professional role will be documented or shared. An agreement will be drawn up between CovUni, project partners and researchers to clarify Intellectual Property that may arise from the project.
