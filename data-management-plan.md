# data management plan

>The Data Management Plan should outline the project’s approach to managing data. It is mandatory to include for all Leadership Fellows, Research, Development and Engagement Fellowship scheme, Research Grants and Follow on Funding applications but is not required for Research Networking. 

>The data management plan can be up to a maximum of two pages long and can include diagrams, but these must be within the 2-page limits.

>Naming Convention: Surname_DMP

## Data types

>1. Briefly introduce the types of data the research will create. Why did you decide to use these data types?

There are two broad research methods in the project: a) practice-research fieldwork; and b) desk-based research.

a) practice-research fieldwork

The fieldwork is an experimental movement practice called Authentic Movement. It will be comprehensively documented through a combination of still images, video and spherical (360º) video: 

1) Still images captured via GoPro Hero 9 as 20mp RAW files (approx 5000x4000 pixels, 300dpi in .gpr format, with .jpg files captured at the same time). The GoPro is required to make still image production as seamless as possible while the reseachers are moving, and the file format provides the most flexibility for post-production and output.

2. Video images captured via GoPro Hero 9 using HEVC codec (H.265) at 4k and 60fps. The GoPro is used to ensure maximum flexibility while the researchers are moving. HEVC is a modern codec that maximises image quality while keeping file sizes relatively small.

3. Spherical video (360º) captured at 6K resolution and stitched to 5.6K



- images for exhibitions
- audio (podcast)
- audio recordings for exhibitions (accessibility)
- video essay (hd, recorded through screenflow)


1. Experimental documentation practices, developed through practice-research fieldwork (RES)
2. Scholarly article about epistemic limits (RES)
3. Exhibition _Unforgettable_ (see Development Plan) (DEV)
4. Exhibition _The Un/knowable Body_ (see Development Plan) (DEV)
5. Scholarly article on epistemic proxies (RES)
6. Lexicon of epistemological findings and failures (RES)
7. Desktop documentary (video essay) of key findings of entire research project (RES)
8. Podcast _The Point Beyond_ (see Development Plan) (DEV)
9. Discourse Forum (see Development Plan) (DEV)
10. Three curated talks online (micro-conferences) (RES)
11. Website (including blog) (RES/DEV)

We will seek the consent of project partners and contributors to make the project’s outputs available with a CC-BY licence. _Finger Pointing Moon_ will produce multiple Open Access digital outputs online, and all are low risk in relation to the complexity and delivery of the project. The following will be stored on the project website (a WordPress site hosted by CovUni): i) experimental documentation practices; ii) audio versions of exhibition materials (for visually impaired audiences); iii) selected visual materials from exhibitions; iv) epistemic lexicon; v) blog. Video content produced for the project will be stored securely, compressed for high-definition quality online storage, streaming, and download through C-DaRE's Vimeo account, and embedded in the project website: i) zoom recordings of curated talks (micro-conferences), ii) video and still-images created during practice-research fieldwork; and iii) desktop documentary (video essay). The Discourse Forum software is open-source and will be hosted and managed by CovUni. The podcast will be hosted off-site at Libsyn, but individual episodes will be embedded in the project website and available through common sources like Apple Podcasts and Spotify.

## Methods to create data

>2. Give details on the proposed methodologies that will be used to create the data. Advise how the project team selected will be suitable for the data/digital aspects of the work, including details of how the institution’s data support teams may need to support the project


## Data storage and backup

>How the data will be stored in the long term
a. What backup will you have in the in-project period to ensure no data is lost?
b. Where have you decided to store it, why is this appropriate?
c. How long will it be stored for and why?
d. Costs of storage – why are these appropriate? Costs related to long term storage will be permitted providing these are fully justified and relate to the project Full justification must be provided in Justification of Resources (JoR)

Throughout the project, all video, photographic, audio, and text data will be uploaded and stored in an internal hosted secure file store set up specifically for the project by Coventry University. The storage is mirrored to a secure ISO27001 off-campus site and subject to a Disaster Recovery Plan. Secure nightly backups are taken. This store will be for the live project data and only authorised people will have access to these data. Coventry University Information Technology Service has processes in place to ensure: the completeness and accuracy of the backed-up data; backup copies of data are stored in a secure manner; data can be restored from a required backup within a reasonable time with authorisation from a data custodian; control of media rotation; secure storage; copies of data are taken on schedule; the secure disposal of data and magnetic media when they are no longer required. There is no storage space limitation for the project and the data will be stored in perpetuity.

## Sharing and value to others

>5. How the data will be shared and the value it will have to others
a. How the data will enhance the area and how it could be used in the future?
b. Releasing the data – advise when you will be releasing and justify if not releasing in line with AHRC guidelines of a minimum of three years. If the data will have value to
different audiences, how these groups will be informed?
c. Will the data need to be updated? Include future plans for updating if this is the case.
d. Will the data be open or will you charge for it? Justify if charging to access the data
e. Financial requirements of sharing – include full justification in the JoR

## Ethical and Legal considerations

>a. Any legal and ethical considerations of collecting the data
b. Legal and ethical considerations around releasing and storing the data – anonymity of
any participants, following promises made to participants


2a: Standards and formats
Open formats (e.g. Theora, Ogg codecs) were considered but due to their low take-up on popular platforms we will use the ubiquitous MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) format for video dissemination. MPEG-4 files can be played natively by modern Mac/PCs and most portable devices. Video material will be encoded with H.264 codec at 1920x1080, 25fps, 10,000kbps, and audio with AAC-LC at 320 kbps, 48 kHz. These are high definition compression rates for web-based storage and streaming and represent an optimum balance of quality, compression, usability, and longevity.
Video formats:
1. Canon XF305: Video: 50Mbps MXF 4:2:2: 1920x1080 25p; Audio: Linear PCM, 16-Bit, 48 kHz
2. Canon 5D Mark IV: Video: Motion MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 VBR 4K (4096 x 2160) MOV 25p; Audio: Linear PCM, 16-Bit, 48 kHz
3. GoPro Hero 5: Video: 4K, 30p, CineForm Codec, mp4; Audio: Linear PCM, 16-bit, 48 kHz
4. Call Recorder for Skype: Video: 1280 x 720, H.264, MOV; Audio: AAC 16-Bit, 44.1 kHz

Material will be uploaded to Vimeo channel at following settings: Video: H.264 MOV files, 25fps, 10,000kbps, 1920x1080; Audio: AAC-LC, 320 kbps, 48 kHz.

We will use the external Vimeo hosting and streaming service to maximise accessibility and cross platform/device use (Vimeo has Flash and HTML5 playback). Video content will also be permanently and securely stored and backed up via the Coventry University institutional repository.
Audio formats:
1. H5Zoom: WAV 16-bit, 48 kHz, stereo
2. Audio Hijack (system recording software): AAC 16-bit, 44.1 kHz, stereo
Photographic formats:
Canon 5D Mark IV: Large/RAW, Approx. 30.1 Megapixels (6720 x 4480). Selected still images uploaded to Flickr Pro account as 3360 x 2240 JPG (150dpi). These data will also be permanently and securely stored and backed up via the Coventry University institutional repository.
