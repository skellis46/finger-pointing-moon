## logic model for entire project

_Current situation - A description of the situation you are trying to change:_ practice-research is widely used in academia, yet poorly understood (both inside and outside academia). Key problem is lack of clarity about epistemic possibilities and limits. (How can this even be called research? scepticism within and outside of academy)

## unforgettable

current situation: the experience of watching and doing dance is slippery; the language we use is diffuse and hard to pin down; yet we are moved by dancing and dance: it moves us (whether at a wedding, in a club or at a theatre). The stories and the language of being moved by dance -- the unforgettable experiences -- are in the aether. Language of experiences of a body-based thing: difficult to describe, yet powerful.
    - what is the problem?
    - what causes the problem?
    - who is affected by the problem? (the clients)
    - who cares about whether or not the problem is solved (stakeholders)
    - what does existing research and experience tell us about how to solve the problem?
aims: to gather and present these stories; to build community; to inspire
