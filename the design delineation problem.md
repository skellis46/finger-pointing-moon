##Â the design delineation problem

Project aim: to address an old and big question: What can we know or understand differently as a consequence of practice-research? 

Project method: to use body-based practice (through practices as well as conventional scholarship) as a case-study by which to address the aim. Body-based practice is an ideal case-study for a number of reasons, mostly to with the inherent ambiguities of the moving body. 

My problem: has these two aspects: 

1) If I use body-based practice as a case-study will it be possible to say anything about ALL practice-research (ie to generalise outwards)? The generalisability of any outcomes would help 'sell' the project to funders -- makes its outcomes more cross-disciplinary, broadens reach of the outcomes, etc. But it might also make the outcomes so broad and so general that they don't serve anyone. This ends up with 'value' not unlike how Foucault describes Borge's list (that I happened across reading Galloway -- see below)

2) If I were to narrow the scope of the research to "what can we know or understand differently as a consequence of body-based research?" then the research design becomes more cogent and clear. But the scope of the project -- and indeed its ambitious rationale/aim -- is diminished. The logic of the research design would be more precise and easier to rationalise, but overall value/significance of the project reduced.

- how to identify tendencies/actions/ways of working that are specific to body-based practices? e.g. making findings a priori -- I'd say it's a general problem, but the messiness of body-based stuff makes it more likely. But is that different from, say, in music composition? 
- likely 'answer' is to keep shifting between global and specific: between all practice-research and body-based. And to be transparent about this shift, and recognise limits of claims I might be able to make. make a case for it being an ideal case-study, that its context is fundamentally body-based work. BUT that a project objective will be to examine how the outcomes might generalise outwards to other practice-research fields

- general problem in practice-research
- body-based as paradigmatic example of complexity of problem
- generate claims/principles that speak directly to body-based
- such claims may be useful or appropriate to practice-research generally but cannot know this. My desire yes. but can't be sure. if the principles and values are so zoomed out then they might become useless. specificity is a key principle -- could use this as example.

>The list represents a collection of things that don't go together -- even when placed in apposition -- and that can't, in principle, be reduced to a single concept that would subsume them. The list resembles the category or the type, but only superficially -- as in Borges' notorious fabulation, those animals "(a) belonging to the Emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) sucking pigs, (e) sirens, (f) fabulous, (g) stray dogs..." -- proving instead the failure of the category, the insufficiency of a symbolic order that can only be approximated through a series of depictions. (This version of the list, recounted at the start of Michel Foucault's The Order of Things, is the object of some consternation regarding its explicit orientalism. Indeed there is something orientalist about all lists.) [@galloway_list_2020]
