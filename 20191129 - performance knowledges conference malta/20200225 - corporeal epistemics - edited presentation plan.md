# corporeal epistemics

## authentic movement and a camera

In August and September 2019 the dancer-choreographer Shaun McLeod and I started working together with a well-known dance-based practice called Authentic Movement. What can be said about what happened in that space during those six weeks of practice? That is, what could we -- meaning all of us in this room -- agree on? What would have been available to your senses from the outside if you had been there? What could we hear or see? 

One person -- the mover -- had their eyes closed pretty much all of the time. The other person -- the watcher -- was watching the mover. He also was taking care of the mover by making sure he didn't bump into anything but I'm not sure we would necessarily realise this or agree on it. Perhaps we would assume that to be the case. The watcher was also holding a smartphone _directed_ at the mover, while not paying any attention to the screen on that phone. 

While the mover had their eyes closed they moved around the space, sometimes this movement was more like a series of stillnesses, other times it was very everyday: like walking, or sitting, or lying. Still other times the mover might shake or do things that were a little less everyday. These movements were sometimes strung together; most of us in this room would call that -- or recognise it as -- contemporary dance, or maybe somatically informed contemporary dance if we were being a bit fancy. But it was definitely not the kind of contemporary dancing I've seen on "So You Think You Can Dance", or at  mainstream Western theatres. I would say the mover looked a little like they were *feeling* or perhaps *sensing*, maybe _looking inside_ or maybe _searching_. But I couldn't be sure, and nor do I think we could all agree on this.

It turns out that the smartphone was taking a photograph every 30 seconds, and the screen was darkened so the watcher (who we could now say was also the photographer) wouldn't know when a photo was being taken nor how anything might be framed in the lens of the camera. 

Here is a set of 31 photos from one 20 minute Authentic Movement session with Shaun as the mover.

And here is another with me as the mover. 

These collections of photos are the visual remains of the practice from last year. Thirty-one photos, randomly framed, systematically taken, and presented here as collections -- as if to represent wholeness. In some ways each strip is probably quite rich compared with how I've just verbally described what was happening in the studio. We can see clothing, the room, positions on the floor, the light, faces, postures, hints of gestures, expressions. But in other ways an enormous quantity of experiential data have not made it from what was in the room to what you can see here. We certainly can infer some things from these photos, the most seductive being what kind of movement occurred. But we are _inferring_ movement. And by inferring I mean _implying_. We'd also be inferring or implying understanding, and we would almost certainly be inferring the presence or absence or quantity of this thing that gets called _embodied knowledge_.

## embodied knowledge as a proxy

In dance scholarship we seem to use the verb _to embody_ rather loosely. Of the various definitions in the OED the closest to our common use seems to be "to put into a body".[@noauthor_embody_2019] A soul or spirit is embodied when it has a body or is "invested with a body"[@noauthor_embodied_2019] This suggests a process of holding or containing in the body something that is not normally thought of as being of the body. And so when we (dance scholars) use the phrase "embodied knowledge" perhaps we are simply drawing attention to a form of understanding that is distinct from common understandings of knowledge, and that is _held_ in the body. 

As dance scholars we seem extraordinarily comfortable with tying ourselves in knots trying to make sense of _embodied knowledge_. Recently, the dance and technology specialist Isabelle Choinière wrote this:

>... somatic intelligence is prioritized as the main tool in this research process. As one of the forms of the physical intelligence, it is an experiential corporal modality, a form of embodied knowledge ... [@choiniere_somatic/embodiment/technology_2018 p.195]

Choinière is suggesting that somatic intelligence is a form of embodied knowledge _and_ is a subset of physical intelligence. Three abstract terms that refer to each other in an intricate choreography of circular logic. 

But I'm not trying to pick on Isabelle Choinière -- at least she attempted to make sense of the terms. Search for the word _embodied_ in a random selection of dance scholarship and there will be few if any attempts to be clear about its meaning and use. 

This absence or -- less kindly -- total mess is not really surprising. In _The Primacy of Movement_ the philosopher Maxine Sheets-Johnstone describes the term _embodiment_ as "little more than a lexical band-aid covering a three-hundred year old Western wound" -- that is, the Cartesian split of mind and body.[@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011 pp.301-311] And she suggests that this split remains "part of our thinking because we have not yet fathomed what it is to be the bodies we are".[@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011 p.310]. In other words, "When we have recourse to 'embodiment,' we avoid coming to terms with bodies, with what is actually there, sensuously present in our experience ..."[@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011 p.312] 

But being sensuously present in our experience as artist-scholars is not likely to be as simple as it sounds. Alva Noë wrote that "hearing, perceiving, learning, is always a matter of using what you know to make sense of what is on offer."[@noe_art_2015] How then are we to notice difference and newness in circumstances when we only know what we know and "don't know what we are looking for?"[@ellis_not_2016] 

For dance scholars, the temptation to assume to know what is there is enormous; to project our desires, ambitions and feelings onto what we can see. In some respects our livelihoods and identities are dependent on the existence of a concept like embodied knowledge. And if we say enough times "this is embodied knowledge, this is embodied knowledge, this is embodied knowledge" -- like a deep mantra to the academic gods -- then we start to accept it as the truth. Not even _a_ truth, but _the_ truth. We are beautifully suggestible beings. 

The problem gets trickier still because, as a participant in these simple Authentic Movement dance experiments, I can -- I want to say -- _testify_ that there is something quite profound going on that is not at all visible from the outside. The key -- and utterly invisible -- idea is that in Authentic Movement both the mover and the watcher are working with a discipline of non-judgement. The discipline of non-judgement underpins all that is radical about the practice. If I were to describe the experience from the inside I would use words like freedom, patience, calmness, pleasure, possibility and playfulness. And it goes without saying that just because these qualities were not able to be seen does not mean I did not experience them. This is key: invisibility. The photographic series Shaun and I made carry none of that experiential information. None. Zero. 

But I also like to imagine there is a middle ground as well; phenomena that are sensuously present in the experience _and_ visible to the watcher. For example, would I be able to say that with my experience as a dancer and watcher of others dancing, I saw qualities of understanding, decision making, attention and perhaps even know-how when Shaun was dancing? And if so, how did I see them? And what was it I was seeing? I imagine it would be difficult to agree on how it was that I was seeing such things, and what I was seeing that made me think or feel those things. It makes me think we are dealing with an epistemic house of cards and I am quite happy with that idea. 

With these cards falling all around me I remain comfortable thinking that Shaun and I both _showed_ or _formed_ examples of two people deploying or revealing attention to -- and sensitivity _of_ -- the body. These were rich and complex experiences for us ... every time. I suspect, but do not and can not know, that part of their richness was because of our _availability_ to movement experiences that, though simple in form and appearance, are wildly complex in how they are generated. We kept going back to these non-judgemental improvisations like children wanting to go back into the water -- excited to try again, to re-enter that state of wildly still abandon. 

But I'm not sure my suspicions are of much value to us here in this room. We can never know if what I suspect is indeed the case. But, what I do think is critical is how I might respond to the following fundamental questions. And they are fundamental to any research practice in any discipline: 

>What do we understand differently as a consequence of this practice?  
>How might those understandings be important to our research community?    
>How might these ideas be shared?  

## insights

I could say that these insights came about through the practice over six weeks last August and September; a practice of process-based movement experiments that involved a discipline of non-judgement, invisible experiences and semi-automated photography. But that would not be the entire truth at all. Because the substantially greater proportion of my understanding evolved in the weeks and months after the practice while I was reading and thinking _about other things for other projects_. This also feels odd because it was as if the intensely collaborative practice of movement with Shaun became a far more isolated and solo practice of words and thought. Which is not, of course, to say that these thoughts or ideas belong to me. As Judith Butler has said, "We are worldless without one another".[@butler_we_2017]

These insights -- or differences or understandings -- were, in reality, circumstantial and arbitrary. They are not predetermined insights or outcomes emanating from a detailed research design. Just happenstance or change. This is not to diminish these ideas, I care about them and I think they are important. I just want to acknowledge that in the late northern summer last year Shaun and I were fabulously lost in the "mangle of practice"[@pickering_mangle_1995] and not so able to see the wood for the trees.

I think there are two key insights -- or ideas -- from this work that I care about and that I think might matter to us in our current conversations. These are: 1) the body as an analogue site able to resist datafication; and 2) resolution of experience.

### 1. the analogue body and datafication

There is an epistemic crisis in body-based practice-research. It is a crisis revealed by the sharp rise in scholarship exploring the nature of embodied knowledge. In much of that research, the idea that the body _knows_ acts as a proxy for the epistemic limitations of practice-research investigations. In other words, artist-scholars who research through movement practices are valorising the concept of embodied knowledge while failing to address what I see as the key epistemic paradox of creative practice-research: that its ontology lies at least in part in what is _not_ able to be known, understood or articulated as a consequence of body-based creative practices.[@ellis_that_2018] This is a humbling limitation for any research method or process, and a crucial problem for practice-research to acknowledge if it is to continue its development in the Academy.

The contemporary cultural backdrop for the tension between so-called embodied knowledge, the unknowable, and the inarticulable is the datafication of human experience. In 2017 _The Economist_ declared that the "world's most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data".[@noauthor_worlds_2017] In 2019, the social psychologist Shoshana Zuboff described the process of _surveillance capitalism_ as "extractive operations in which our personal experiences are scraped and packaged as the means to others' ends".[@zuboff_age_2019 Chapter 1] Zuboff also uses the word _rendition_ to describe a two-sided process. On one side are the technologies of surveillance capitalism that are designed to "render our experience into data, as in rendering oil from fat".[@zuboff_age_2019 Chapter 8.1] On the other side is the fact that "every time we encounter a digital interface we make our experience available to 'datafication'".[@zuboff_age_2019 Chapter 8.1] We _render_ "unto surveillance capitalism" a continuous supply of raw materials. 

The cultural and financial capital of understanding the world-as-data means it is not surprising that precarious and delicate artistic practices and processes located in and through the body -- like dance and somatics -- have also become enamoured by the doctrine of datafication. The growing number of online archives, digital forms of documentation, and virtual and augmented reality projects are all implicit or explicit attempts by dance scholars to transform the radically analogue nature of bodily experiences into data.

I am interested in these two phenomena: the limitations of body-based practice-research, and the datafication of human experience. These phenomena are related because the construction and production of knowledge in any scholarly field is never based on the simple and objective observation of worldly things. Rather, to understand what we say we know and do not know, the vital epistemic question is, according to the social scientist and semiotician Walter Mignolo, "who, when, [and] why is constructing knowledges?"[-@mignolo_epistemic_2009 p.160] If the overwhelming contemporary phenomenon is the extraction of data from human experiences, then the question of _who, when and why is constructing knowledges_ necessitates an encounter with the limits and excesses of datafication. 

I want to propose that complex and radically analogue human experiences like experimental choreographic and movement practices have ontologies that are underpinned by two key characteristics: 1) they defy the capacity to be accurately and wholly articulated and shared; and 2) they exceed "algorithmic description".[@odell_how_2019 p.xvi] My curiosity is positioned squarely at the intersection of the datafication of human experience and the limitations of body-based practice-research. 

I see Authentic Movement as an experimental practice that foregrounds radically analogue human experiences: It is process-oriented; it is not made to be publicly viewed or consumed; much if not all of what happens that is important is invisible to the eye; it is a practice of non-judgement; it is inordinately simple in form, but vastly open-ended in possible experiential complexity; and it is accessible or available to anyone that wants to be involved. I see it in this way as a paradigmatic example of a movement practice that exceeds algorithmic description.

### 2. resolution of experience

When Shaun and I were working together in the summer we were inserting variations and possibilities into the daily practice. We were creating accidents of thinking and iteration. We were aware early on of the gap or discrepancy between the complex and rich internal experiences (both for the mover and the watcher) and what was visible _on the outside_. It seemed obvious to ask: what if we insert a camera into this predominantly invisible experience/practice? What might _the_ ocular-centric recording device of our time -- the smartphone -- do to the unseen? 

But then, one or two months after we finished the work together, I happened to be reading -- for an entirely different project -- Boaventura de Sousa Santos's 2001 article _Toward an Epistemology of Blindness_ [-@santos_toward_2001]. In that article de Sousa Santos states that "the resolution level of our [scientific] methods is higher than the resolution level of our theories."[-@santos_toward_2001 p.261]

I think his concept of resolution is useful, even if, in effect, I have robbed him of his thinking in a particular field and for a particular context, to help make sense of the relationship between experience and representation in the work with Shaun. 

My digital theft of de Sousa Santos' thinking is a way to remind us that when we are dealing with body-based practices what we can observe bears little or no relationship to the experiential complexity of what happened. That is, we have high resolution experiences, and low resolution representations of those experiences. And that gap or difference applies irrespective of how fancy our technocratic solutions are as online archives or web-based responses to performance works.

In dance and the performing arts there's a long history of scholarship and experience exploring the relationship and differences between the _liveness_ of movement practices and those practices as mediated or mediatized on film or video. I used to imagine Philip Auslander and Peggy Phelan scrapping it out in a kick-boxing bout. Phil appeared to be on odds-on favourite for a tech nerd like me, but Peggy packed some serious punch. In my dreams, it was carnage, and there was blood on the dance floor. I remember also that when we applied for public funding in the 1990s, Shaun used to describe the recordings of past performances submitted as part of new applications as, "death by video". 

What I think I'm doing here is re-packaging an old idea with a history as old as the advent of recording technologies. _That_ history has tended to speak of loss or death when describing the transmutation of live performance into some digital other. But I propose that the word transmutation -- to change into another nature, substance, form, or condition -- is inaccurate. What we have in these images of Shaun and me practising Authentic Movement are coarse-grain materials that tell us plenty about how that world looked. These photographs -- at least in their original digital form on my hard drive or on servers around the world -- also possess an enormous quantity of metadata. And metadata is not -- as Edward Snowden says -- "some benign abstraction" but "the very essence of content".[@snowden_permanent_2019 Chapter 16] 

These photos tell us everything, _and_ they tell us nothing. 

The photo so directly and beautifully captures the hyper-visual nature of our time, as well as the power of superficiality. These visual data are both thick and thin. They are everything and nothing. They are both sides of a boolean operator. On _and_ off. Zero _and_ one. Yes _and_ no. They provide all of the answers _and_ none of the answers. They are knowing _and_ not knowing. They represent an epistemic paradoxe. 

## staking claims and humility

If it's not already clear, I'm profoundly interested in experiences that are not really able to be articulated. They are experiences with, in and around our "sentient, practising, tool-wielding"[@marchand_making_2010-1 p.S2] bodies that resist description. They are experiences that are cloaked and revealed in movement and stillness. This is not to say that we shouldn't keep seeking ways to articulate that which cannot be articulated. That in such a paradox we might inadvertently step into alternative tangles and mangles. 

The epistemics of such a paradox is important because I understand the Academy to be the ideal place to attempt to contain or hold the things we cannot know: the sublime, the unsayable. But to keep this paradox alive, and not to dilute it with imprecision, or "reductionist interests and goals" [@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011 p.501]. To keep the paradox alive demands that we approach the body and the context for its deployment in the construction of knowledges with humility. 

And why humility? Because the body can also be a site that is not for staking claims like we all do in Academia, and that perhaps I am guilty of right this moment. That the politics of humility demand collaborative inquiry, an excess of community (the 'we'), a deep engagement with (and love for) uncertainty, a dance with the unknown. It is humility that resists reductive datafication; these beautiful bodies: refusing to disappear as they go on in their vital project of resisting the extractive processes of Zuboff's surveillance capitalism.

# edit bin

It fascinates me that Choinière also includes the word _skill_ in her description, as if implicitly calling on the phronetic know-how of Aristotle, David Carr and Gilbert Ryle.[@ellis_that_2018]

It's like that scene in Annie Hall where a movie producer says, "Right now it's only a notion, but I think I can get money to make it into a concept, and later turn it into an idea."[@pinker_sense_2014] 

The same with embodied intelligence, and even embodied awareness. We often also use words interchangeably as if they might be the same thing: somatic for embodied or physical, somatic or physical for body, intelligence for knowledge.

A number of seemingly un-related ideas and possibilities that happened to end up together. 

>For the body cannot be easily contained by the consumption imperative. It discovers its own sexual and political being and overflows autonomously in many other directions as well. Or, as in the case of the state policies of economic and cultural austerity that have increasingly been imposed upon a recalcitrant underlying population, the body refuses to disappear as a subject.

-- Stanley Aronwitz, foreward in Martin's *Performance as a Political Act* [-@martin_performance_1990 p.viii] 



In effect, I robbed de Sousa Santos of his thinking in a particular field and for a particular context, to help make sense of the relationship between experience and representation in the work with Shaun. Or perhaps I just borrowed his thinking. It's definitely different though from a citation because he was writing for an utterly different context, and with utterly different ambitions for how the thinking might be met and used. It's not a loan either. More like digital theft when the owner doesn't lose any materials or things, after all his thinking as presented in that writing is endlessly reproducible. But perhaps some of his writing's aura or value is diluted as it is dropped into a different world, with different ideologies, different practices, and different needs? But I digress.

And it's also important to note that what I now understand differently are not insights into the nature and experience of our sensitised and sensitising bodies. In this research, the state, quality or even quantity of body-based understanding -- sensuous presence in experience -- was merely a thing. But it wasn't any _thing_ special, and it wasn't anything that people haven't already been doing for a long long time in Authentic Movement. 

like two people sitting in the same room at a party who end up deeply in love for the rest of their lives. 

Research insights invariably reveal what we care about as individuals, and what might matter to us most as a community. The following insights (or emergent understandings) are no different. 

It's not unlike sniffing deeply into a glass of red wine and saying the words "cinnamon and blackcurrant" as some friends are about to try the same wine. They are infected by the idea of the scents, not the scents themselves, but nevertheless will swear blind they can taste cinnamon and blackcurrent. 

Or here is the artist-scholar Andrea Davidson: 

>For dance practitioners, somatic intelligence constitutes a model of corporeal experience: a form of embodied knowledge that can also be described as a skill for sensing, relating and ‘revealing'.[@davidson_somatics_2013 p.6]

## phones, feelings and our radically analogue bodies

I imagine the body as a wild space of feelings. [gif] Yes feelings. Those things that drive all conversations, all experiences. Nuanced, primitive, primal. All that we are saying, all that we are hearing, all that we are communicating and proposing, is driven by feelings: 

>conversations do not just involve feelings, they are at their very core about feelings" [@stone_difficult_2003 p.13]

To feel smart, to feel less clumsy, to feel busy, to avoid the fear of failure, to feel wanted or needed, to feel successful, to be repelled by ambition, to feel less lonely, to be respected, valued, loved even. To feel superior, less inferior, to feel astonished, eager, energetic, confused, excited, significant or insignificant. 

The wild spaces of our analogue bodies understand these things. I am never just this or that, never just busy or needy, never just superior or inferior. And with all these feelings, all these states and traits, memories and traumas, the ghosts of our pasts, we are all dancing some kind of dance. They are dances of love and laughter, dances of shame and embarrassment, dances of patience and care, dances of pride and pleasure, of honesty and lies. I mean, _who are you_ if there's nothing wrong with you?

In February 2020 the German artist Simon Weckert put 99 smartphones into a small red trolley, walked around Berlin and created what he called a "virtual traffic jam" in Google Maps.[@weckert_google_2020]

In January 2019, the social psychologist Shoshana Zuboff published a book called _Surveillance Capitalism_. In it she uses the word _rendition_ to describe a two-sided process. On one side are the technologies of surveillance capitalism that are designed to "render our experience into data, as in rendering oil from fat".[@zuboff_age_2019 Chapter 8.1] On the other side is the fact that "every time we encounter a digital interface we make our experience available to 'datafication'".[@zuboff_age_2019 Chapter 8.1] We _render_ "unto surveillance capitalism" a continuous supply of raw materials. 

According to Zuboff, the rendition of our bodies begins quite simply with our phones.[@zuboff_age_2019 Chapter 8.2] 

Let's begin by turning off our mobile phones. Turning them off completely. Humour me. There's no need to be jaded or cynical. There's time for that in the next session. We can quietly create the opposite of Weckert's virtual traffic jam: we can create a gap in the geolocation map. A small absence. A silence. It's just us. Untracked for 15 minutes. Going dark. Bliss. We can create a wild space. Like the body. A wild space: unpredictable and inextractable. A place for our analogue selves and our radically analogue bodies. A place where something is not simply yes or no, this or that, 1 or 0, anything but boolean, untouched, untouchable. A body that, even just briefly, resists the facts and fictions of sampling, the logic and ideology of data, and the datafication of the world.
