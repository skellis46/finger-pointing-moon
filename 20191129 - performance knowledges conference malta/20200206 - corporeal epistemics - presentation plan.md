# Corporeal epistemics

In February 2020 the German artist Simon Weckert put 99 smartphones into a small red trolley, walked around Berlin and created what he calls a "virtual traffic jam" in Google Maps.

In January 2019, the social psychologist Shoshana Zuboff published a book called _Surveillance Capitalism_. In it she uses the word _rendition_ to describe a two-sided process:

>On one side, [surveillance capitalism's] technologies are designed to render our experience into data, as in rendering oil from fat. This typically occurs outside of our awareness, let alone our consent. On the other side ... every time we encounter a digital interface we make our experience available to “datafication,” thus “rendering unto surveillance capitalism” its continuous tithe of raw-material supplies. [@zuboff_age_2019 Chapter 8.1]

>The rendition of your body begins quite simply with your phone. [@zuboff_age_2019]

So, let's begin by turning off our mobile phones. Turning them off completely. Humour me. Don't be jaded or cynical. There's time for that in the next session. We can quietly create the opposite of Weckert's virtual traffic jam, and in its place create a gap in the map. A small absence. A silence. It's just us. Untracked for 15 minutes. Going dark. Bliss. We can create a wild space. Like the body. A wild space: unpredictable and inextractable. A place for our analogue selves and our radically analogue bodies. A place where something is not simply yes or no, this or that, 1 or 0, anything but boolean, untouched, untouchable. A body that, even just briefly, resists the facts and fictions of sampling, the logic and ideology of data, and the datafication of the world. It is wild space of feelings. Yes feelings. [gif] Those things that drive all conversations, all experiences. Nuanced, primitive, primal. All that we are saying, all that we are hearing, all that we are communicating and proposing, is driven by feelings:

>conversations do not just involve feelings, they are at their very core about feelings" [@stone_difficult_2003 p.13]

Feelings. To feel smart, to feel less clumsy, to feel busy, to avoid the fear of failure, to feel wanted or needed, to feel successful, to be repelled by ambition, to feel less lonely, to be respected, valued, loved even. To feel superior, less inferior, to feel astonished, eager, energetic, confused, excited, significant or insignificant. 

The wild spaces of our analogue bodies understand these things. I am never just this or that, never just busy or needy, nor superior or inferior. And with all these feelings, all these states and traits we are all dancing. They are dances of self-loathing, dances of love and laughter, dances of patience and care, dances of pride and pleasure, of honesty and lies. Who are you if there's nothing wrong with you? 
 
[dance - for camera - sound and vision, playback on computer - just through the speakers] 

It doesn't matter how this dance is recorded, how this dance ends up online or even on this screen, there exists a remarkable and remarkably beautiful gap in resolution between the dance and its digital other. This gap is not about how it looks, the shapes in space, the timings, the gradations and articulations of joints, even the tone of muscles: the very very many things that make up the dancing body. Yes, the dancing is performative, a digital version  formative. And that gap in resolution ...

Not something lost, something missing. 

, in reality, formative, rather than performative. s so true that our wildly and radically analogue bodies are performative, and capable of performance. It's not that this dance is performative, but also that it's formative. 


In August and September 2019 the New Zealand born dancer-choreographer Shaun McLeod and I (also, and not coincidentally a New Zealand born dancer-choreographer) did nothing nearly as fancy or smart as Weckert or Zuboff. Nor did we do anything that seems to be related.
