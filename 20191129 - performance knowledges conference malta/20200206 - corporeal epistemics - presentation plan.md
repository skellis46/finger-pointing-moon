## phones, feelings and our radically analogue bodies

In February 2020 the German artist Simon Weckert put 99 smartphones into a small red trolley, walked around Berlin and created what he called a "virtual traffic jam" in Google Maps.[@weckert_google_2020]

In January 2019, the social psychologist Shoshana Zuboff published a book called _Surveillance Capitalism_. In it she uses the word _rendition_ to describe a two-sided process. On one side are the technologies of surveillance capitalism that are designed to "render our experience into data, as in rendering oil from fat".[@zuboff_age_2019 Chapter 8.1] On the other side is the fact that "every time we encounter a digital interface we make our experience available to 'datafication'".[@zuboff_age_2019 Chapter 8.1] We _render_ "unto surveillance capitalism" a continuous supply of raw materials. 

According to Zuboff, the rendition of our bodies begins quite simply with our phones.[@zuboff_age_2019 Chapter 8.2] 

So, let's begin by turning off our mobile phones. Turning them off completely. Humour me. There's no need to be jaded or cynical. There's time for that in the next session. We can quietly create the opposite of Weckert's virtual traffic jam, and in its place create a gap in the geolocation map. A small absence. A silence. It's just us. Untracked for 15 minutes. Going dark. Bliss. We can create a wild space. Like the body. A wild space: unpredictable and inextractable. A place for our analogue selves and our radically analogue bodies. A place where something is not simply yes or no, this or that, 1 or 0, anything but boolean, untouched, untouchable. A body that, even just briefly, resists the facts and fictions of sampling, the logic and ideology of data, and the datafication of the world. It is wild space of feelings. Yes feelings. [gif] Those things that drive all conversations, all experiences. Nuanced, primitive, primal. All that we are saying, all that we are hearing, all that we are communicating and proposing, is driven by feelings: 

>conversations do not just involve feelings, they are at their very core about feelings" [@stone_difficult_2003 p.13]

Feelings. To feel smart, to feel less clumsy, to feel busy, to avoid the fear of failure, to feel wanted or needed, to feel successful, to be repelled by ambition, to feel less lonely, to be respected, valued, loved even. To feel superior, less inferior, to feel astonished, eager, energetic, confused, excited, significant or insignificant. 

The wild spaces of our analogue bodies understand these things. I am never just this or that, never just busy or needy, nor superior or inferior. And with all these feelings, all these states and traits, memories and traumas, the ghosts of our pasts, we are all dancing some kind of dance. They are dances of love and laughter, dances of shame and embarrassment, dances of patience and care, dances of pride and pleasure, of honesty and lies. I mean, _who are you_ if there's nothing wrong with you?

## authentic movement and a camera

In August and September 2019 the New Zealand born dancer-choreographer Shaun McLeod and I (also a New Zealand born dancer-choreographer) started working together with a well-known dance-based practice called Authentic Movement. 

What can be said about what happened in that space during those six weeks of practice? That is, what could we -- meaning all of us in this room -- agree on? What would have been available to your senses from the outside if you had been there? What could we hear or see? 

One person -- the mover -- had their eyes closed pretty much all of the time. The other person -- the watcher -- was watching the mover. He also was taking care of the mover by making sure he didn't bump into anything but I'm not sure we would necessarily realise this or agree on it. The watcher was also holding a smartphone _directed_ at the mover, but not paying any attention to the screen. 

While the mover had their eyes closed they moved around the space, sometimes this movement was more like a series of stillnesses, other times it was very everyday: like walking, or sitting, or lying. Still other times the mover might shake or do things that were a little less everyday. These movements were sometimes strung together; most of us in this room would call that -- or recognise it as -- contemporary dance, or maybe somatically informed contemporary dance if we were being a bit fancy. But it was definitely not the kind of contemporary dancing I've seen on "So You Think You Can Dance", or at bigger mainstream Western dance venues. I would say the mover looked a little like they were *feeling* or perhaps *sensing*, maybe _looking inside_ or maybe searching. But I couldn't be sure, and nor do I think we could all agree on this.

It turns out that the smartphone was taking a photograph every 30 seconds, and the screen was darkened so the watcher (who I guess we could say was also the photographer) wouldn't know when a photo was being taken nor how anything might be framed in the lens of the camera. 

Here is a set of 31 photos from one 20 minute authentic movement session with Shaun as the mover.

And here is another with me as the mover. 

These photos are all that is visually left of the practice from last year. Thirty-one photos, randomly taken, and presented here as a collection -- as if to represent wholeness. Each strip seems aestheticised to me -- some care has been taken in laying out the images. In some ways each strip is probably quite rich compared with how I've just verbally described what was happening in the studio. We can see clothing, shapes, the room, positions on the floor, the light, faces, postures, hints of gestures, expressions. But in other ways I'd suggest that an enormous quantity of experiential data have not made it from what was in the room, to what you can see here. We certainly can infer some things from these photos, the most seductive being what kind of movement occurred. But we are _inferring_ movement. And by inferring I mean _leading to_ or _implying_. And we'd then be inferring understanding, and we would almost certainly be inferring the presence or absence or quantity of _embodied knowledge_.

## embodied knowledge as a proxy

In dance scholarship we seem to use the verb _to embody_ rather loosely and confusingly. Of the various definitions in the OED---and putting aside some of the military-oriented etymologies as in "the number of embodied troops" from 1803---the closest to our common use seems to be "to put into a body" or "invest or clothe (a spirit) with a body".[@noauthor_embody_2019] A soul or spirit is embodied when it has a body or is "invested with a body"[@noauthor_embodied_2019] Perhaps this suggests a process of holding or containing in the body something that is not normally thought of as being of the body. And so when we (dance scholars) use the phrase "embodied knowledge" perhaps we are simply drawing attention to a form of understanding that is distinct from common understandings of knowledge, and that is _held_ in the body. The same with embodied intelligence, and even embodied awareness. It gets more messy too because we often seem to use words interchangeably as if they might be the same thing: somatic for embodied or physical, somatic or physical for body, intelligence for knowledge, 

As dance scholars we seem to be extraordinarily comfortable with tying ourselves in knots trying to make sense of _embodied knowledge_. Recently, the dance and technology specialist Isabelle Choinière wrote this:

>... somatic intelligence is prioritized as the main tool in this research process. As one of the forms of the physical intelligence, it is an experiential corporal modality, a form of embodied knowledge that can be described as an increased skill to sense, to perceive and to relate. [@choiniere_somatic/embodiment/technology_2018 p.195]

Choinière is suggesting that somatic intelligence is a form of embodied knowledge _and_ is a subset of physical intelligence. Three abstract terms that refer to each other in an intricate choreography of circular logic. 

It's like that scene in Annie Hall where a movie producer says, "Right now it’s only a notion, but I think I can get money to make it into a concept, and later turn it into an idea."[@pinker_sense_2014] 

Or here is the artist-scholar Andrea Davidson: 

>For dance practitioners, somatic intelligence constitutes a model of corporeal experience: a form of embodied knowledge that can also be described as a skill for sensing, relating and ‘revealing’.[@davidson_somatics_2013 p.6]

It fascinates me that both of these experienced artists include the word _skill_ in their descriptions, as if silently calling on the phronetic know-how of Aristotle, David Carr and Gilbert Ryle.[@ellis_that_2018]

But I'm not trying to pick on Isabelle Choinière and Andrea Davidson here -- at least they attempted to make sense of the terms. Search for the word _embodied_ in a random selection of dance scholarship and there will be few if any attempts to be clear about its meaning and use. 

This absence -- or less kindly -- total mess is not really surprising. In _The Primacy of Movement_ the philosopher Maxine Sheets-Johnstone describes the term _embodiment_ as "little more than a lexical band-aid covering a three-hundred year old Western wound" -- that is, the Cartesian split of mind and body.[@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011 pp.301-311] And she suggests that this split remains "part of our thinking because we have not yet fathomed what it is to be the bodies we are".[@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011 p.310]. The various _embodiments_ only "serve reductionist interests and goals" [@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011 p.501]. In other words, "When we have recourse to 'embodiment,' we avoid coming to terms with bodies, with what is actually there, sensuously present in our experience ..."[@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011 p.312] 

With what is actually there, sensuously present in our experience. 

But being sensuously present in our experience as artist-scholars is not likely to be as simple as it sounds. Alva Noë wrote that "hearing, perceiving, learning, is always a matter of using what you know to make sense of what is on offer."[@noe_art_2015] How then "are we to notice difference and newness in circumstances when we don’t know what we are looking for?"[@ellis_not_2016] 

For dance scholars, the temptation to assume to know what is there is enormous; to project our desire, ambition and indeed feelings onto what we can see. In some respects our livelihoods and identities are dependent on the existence of a concept like embodied knowledge. And if we say enough times "this is embodied knowledge, this is embodied knowledge, this is embodied knowledge, this is embodied knowledge" -- like a deep mantra to the academic gods -- then we start to accept it as the truth. Not even _a_ truth, but _the_ truth. It's not unlike sniffing deeply at a glass of red wine and saying the words "cinnamon and blackcurrant" as some friends are about to try the same wine. They are infected by the idea of the scents, not the scents themselves, but nevertheless will swear blind they can taste cinnamon and blackcurrent. We are, after all, beautifully suggestible beings. 

The problem gets messier still. Because, as a participant in these simple authentic movement dance experiments I can -- I want to say _testify_ -- that there is something quite profound going on that is not at all visible from the outside. The key -- and utterly invisible -- idea is that in authentic movement both the mover and the watcher are working with a discipline of non-judgement. The discipline underpins all that is radical about the practice. If I were to describe the experience from the privileged position of a participant, I would use words like freedom, agency, patience, calmness, pleasure, openness, possibility, playfulness, carefreeness and effortlessness. And it goes without saying that just because these qualities were not able to be seen does not mean I did not experience them. This is key: invisibility. The photographic series Shaun and I made carry none of that experiential information. Zero. 

But I also like to imagine there is a middle ground as well; phenomena that are sensuously present in the experience _and_ visible to the watcher. For example, would I be able to say that with my experience as a dancer and watcher of others dancing, I saw qualities of understanding, experience, decision making, attention and perhaps even know-how when Shaun was dancing. And if so, how did I see them? And what was it I was seeing? I suspect it would be difficult to agree on how it was that I was seeing such things, and what I was seeing that made me think or feel those things. It makes me think we are dealing with an epistemic house of cards and I am quite happy with that idea. 

With these cards falling all around me I remain comfortable thinking that Shaun and I both _showed_ or _formed_ examples of people deploying or revealing attention to -- and sensitivity _of_ -- the body. These were rich and complex experiences for us ... every time. I suspect, but do not and can not know, that part of their richness was because of our _availability_ to movement experiences that though simple in form and appearance, are wildly complex in how they are generated. We kept going back to these non-judgemental improvisations like children wanting to go back into the water -- excited to try again, to re-enter that state of wildly still abandon. 

But I'm not sure my suspicions are of much value to us here in this room. We can never know if what I suspect is indeed the case. But, what I do think is critical is how I might respond to the following fundamental questions. And they are fundamental to any research practice of any kind: 

>What do we understand differently as a consequence of this practice? 
>How might those understandings be important to our research community?  
>How might these ideas be shared?  


## insights

I suspect (so so many suspicions) that any research insights -- perhaps more so in the arts and humanities -- reveal what we care about as individuals, and what might matter to us most as a community. The following insights (or emergent understandings) are no different. 

I could say that these insights came about through the practice over six weeks last August and September; a practice of process-based movement experiments that involved a discipline of non-judgement, invisible experiences and semi-automated photography. But that would not be the entire truth at all. Because the substantially greater proportion of my understanding evolved in the weeks and months after the practice while I was reading and thinking _about other things for other projects_. This also feels odd because it was as if the intensely collaborative practice of movement with Shaun became a far more isolated and individualistic practice of words and thought. Which is not, of course, to say that these thoughts or ideas belong to me. As Judith Butler has said, "We are worldless without one another".[@butler_we_2017]

In this respect, these insights -- or differences or understandings -- were, in reality, circumstantial and implausibly arbitrary. A number of seemingly un-related ideas and possibilities that happened to end up together, like two people sitting in the same room at a party who end up deeply in love for the rest of their lives. They are not predetermined insights or outcomes emanating from a detailed research design. Just happenstance or change. This is not to diminish these ideas, I care about them and I think they are important. Rather, I just want to acknowledge that in the late northern summer last year Shaun and I were fabulously lost in the "mangle of practice".[@pickering_mangle_1995] 

And it's also important to note that what I now understand differently are not insights into the nature and experience of our sensitised and sensitising bodies. In this research, the state, quality or even quantity of body-based understanding -- sensuous presence in experience -- was merely a thing. But it wasn't any _thing_ special, and it wasn't anything that people haven't already been doing for a long long time in authentic movement. 

I think there are two key insights -- or ideas -- from this work that I care about and that I think might matter to us in our current conversations. These are: 1) the body as an analogue site able to resist datafication; and 2) resolution of experience.

### 1. the analogue body and datafication

There is an epistemic crisis in body-based practice-research. It is a crisis revealed by the sharp rise in scholarship exploring the nature of embodied knowledge. In much of that research, I suspect that the idea that the body _knows_ acts as a proxy for the epistemic limitations of practice-research investigations. In other words, artist-scholars who research through movement practices are valorising the concept of embodied knowledge while failing to address what I see as the key epistemic paradox of creative practice-research: that its ontology lies at least in part in what is _not_ able to be known, understood or articulated as a consequence of body-based creative practices.[@ellis_that_2018] This is a humbling limitation for any research method or process, and a crucial problem for practice-research to acknowledge if it is to continue its development in the Academy.

The contemporary cultural backdrop for the tension between so-called embodied knowledge, the unknowable, and the inarticulable is the datafication of human experience. In 2017 _The Economist_ declared that the "world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data".[@noauthor_worlds_2017] This age of _surveillance capitalism_ is founded on "extractive operations in which our personal experiences are scraped and packaged as the means to others’ ends".[@zuboff_age_2019 Chapter 1] The cultural and financial capital of understanding the world-as-data means it is not surprising that precarious and delicate artistic practices and processes located in and through the body -- like dance and somatics -- have also become enamoured by the doctrine of datafication. The rapidly growing number of online archives, digital forms of documentation, and virtual and augmented reality projects are all implicit or explicit attempts by dance scholars to transform the radically analogue nature of bodily experiences into data.

I am interested in these two phenomena: the limitations of body-based practice-research, and the datafication of human experience. These phenomena are related because the construction and production of knowledge in any scholarly field is never based on the simple and objective observation of worldly things. Rather, to understand what we say we know and do not know, the vital epistemic question is in fact, according to Walter Mignolo, "who, when, [and] why is constructing knowledges?"[@mignolo_epistemic_2009 p.160] If the overwhelming contemporary phenomenon is the extraction of data from human experiences, then the question of _who, when and why is constructing knowledges_ necessitates an encounter with the limits and excesses of datafication. 

I want to propose that complex and radically analogue human experiences like experimental choreographic and movement practices have ontologies that are underpinned by two key characteristics: 1) they defy the capacity to be accurately and wholly articulated and shared; and 2) they exceed "algorithmic description".[@odell_how_2019 p.xvi] My curiosity is positioned squarely at the intersection of the datafication of human experience and the limitations of body-based practice-research. 

I see Authentic Movement as an experimental practice that foregrounds radically analogue human experiences: It is process-oriented; it is not made to be publicly viewed or consumed; much if not all of what happens that is important is invisible to the eye; it is a practice of non-judgement; it is inordinately simple in form, but vastly open-ended in possible experiential complexity; and it is accessible or available to anyone that wants to be involved. I see it in this way as a paradigmatic example of a movement practice that exceeds algorithmic description.

### 2. resolution of experience

When Shaun and I were working together in the summer we were inserting variations and possibilities into the daily practice. We were creating accidents of thinking and iteration. We were aware early on of the gap or discrepancy between the complex and rich internal experiences (both for the mover and the watcher) and what was visible _on the outside_. It seemed obvious to ask: what if we insert a camera into this predominantly invisible experience/practice? What might _the_ ocular-centric recording device of our time -- the smartphone -- do to the unseen? 

But then, one or two months after we finished the work together, I happened to be reading -- for an entirely different project -- Boaventura de Sousa Santos's 2001 article _Toward an Epistemology of Blindness_ [-@santos_toward_2001]. de Sousa Santos's states that "the resolution level of our [scientific] methods is higher than the resolution level of our theories." (p.261) In effect, I robbed de Sousa Santos of his thinking in a particular field and for a particular context, to help make sense of the relationship between experience and representation in the work with Shaun. Or perhaps I just borrowed his thinking. It's definitely different though from a citation because he was writing for an utterly different context, and with utterly different ambitions for how the thinking might be met and used. It's not a loan either. More like digital theft when the owner doesn't lose any materials or things, after all his thinking as presented in that writing is endlessly reproducible. But perhaps some of his writing's aura or value is diluted as it is dropped into a different world, with different ideologies, different practices, and different needs? But I digress.

In dance and the performing arts there's a long history of scholarship and experience exploring and attempting to understand the relationship and differences between the _liveness_ of movement practices and those practices mediated or mediatized on film or video. I used to imagine Philip Auslander and Peggy Phelan scrapping it out in a kick-boxing bout. Phil appeared to be on odds-on favourite for a tech nerd like me, but Peggy packed some serious punch. In my dreams, it was carnage, and there was blood on the dance floor. I remember also that when we applied for public funding in the 1990s, Shaun used to describe the recordings of past performances submitted as part of new applications as "death by video". 

But the concept of resolution is useful.

My digital theft of de Sousa Santos' thinking is to propose that when we are dealing with body-based practices what we can observe bears little or no relationship to the experiential complexity of what happened. That is, we have high resolution experiences, and low resolution representations of those experiences. And that gap or difference applies irrespective of how fancy the online archive or web-based response to performance works.

What I think I'm doing here is re-packaging an old idea with a history as old as the advent of recording technologies. That history has tended to speak of loss or death when describing the transmutation of live performance into some digital other. But in my proposal the word transmutation -- to change into another nature, substance, form, or condition -- is inaccurate. What we have in these images of Shaun and me practising authentic movement is a coarse-grain ... tells us so much. and muc of that able to be datafied: gelocation, meta-data from the photos. But it also tell us nothing.

example here -- of a recent photo -- something about those photos of canon balls? 

The photo so directly mines the hyper-visual nature of the world, and the veil of that world. the thin-ness of the data. entrhall to it. 

## staking claims and humility

If it's not already clear, I'm profoundly interested in experiences that are not really able to be articulated. They are experiences with, in and around our "sentient, practising, tool-wielding"[@marchand_making_2010-1 p.S2] bodies that resist description. They are experiences that are cloaked and revealed in movement and stillness. This is not to say that we shouldn't keep seeking ways to articulate that which cannot be articulated. That in such a paradox we might inadvertently step into alternative tangles and mangles. 

The epistemics of such a paradox is important because I understand the Academy to be the ideal place to attempt to contain or hold the things we cannot know: the sublime, the unsayable. But to keep this paradox alive, and not to dilute it with imprecison The various _embodiments_ only "serve reductionist interests and goals" [@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011 p.501]. To keep the paradox alive demands that we approach the body and the context for its deployment in the construction of knowledges with humility. 

And why humility? Because the body can also be a site that is not for staking claims (like we all do in Academia, and that perhaps I am guilty of right this moment). That the politics of humility demand collaborative inquiry, an excess of community (the 'we'), a deep engagement with (and love for) uncertainty, a dance with the unknown. It is humility that resists reductive datafication; these beautiful bodies: going on in their project of resisting the extractive processes of Zuboff's surveillance capitalism.

>For the body cannot be easily contained by the consumption imperative. It discovers its own sexual and political being and overflows autonomously in many other directions as well. Or, as in the case of the state policies of economic and cultural austerity that have increasingly been imposed upon a recalcitrant underlying population, the body refuses to disappear as a subject.

-- Stanley Aronwitz, foreward in Martin's *Performance as a Political Act* [-@martin_performance_1990 p.viii] 

I'm going to finish now so we can all stop our embodied fidgeting and turn our phones back on.

>If the key epistemic question is "who, when, why is constructing knowledges?"[@mignolo_epistemic_2009 p.160] then in this presentation I will attempt to discuss the epistemic _why_ of experiences that are unable to be discussed. They are experiences of politics and humility that underpin the radically analogue nature of the human body; they are experiences that exceed "algorithmic description";[@odell_how_2019 p.xvi] perhaps they are even experiences or _acts_ of "epistemic disobedience".[@mignolo_epistemic_2009 p.160]

I'm going to abandon the term _embody_ (or any of its constructions) now. I suggest you try it. It's like being let off some crazy circular train that has no stops.

>The challenge then becomes to build perceptual tools and systems of communication with others (and with ourselves) that help reveal the things we want to see and hear, and that we imagine we have seen and heard.[@ellis_not_2016]

I wonder if we can we all agree that there was embodied knowledge in that laboratory dance space? But this in itself is an absurd question. I mean when is there not embodied knowledge in any room? It's here now. We don't have to be moving. So, do we then mean a certain level or quantity of embodied knowledge? Is there some kind of threshold when embodied knowledge becomes useful or noticeable? Or when we use the term 'embodied research' do we just mean research that focuses on the body by people with bodies trained and sensitised to the complexities of the moving, sensing body? Perhaps I am being provocatively simplistic or stubborn here but sometimes it sure feels as if that embodied emperor isn't wearing any clothes; not that I'd want to point that out.

proxy of embodied knowledge devalues rich experiences that are unable to be discussed. Sheets-Johnstone and Ingold. finger pointing moon.

relate 'the truth' to OED definition of embodied.

Ben Spatz recently advertised a workshop in which he describes ... 
Journal of Embodied Research.
Does that mean all the other journals only handle disembodied research? 

But the clincher is that we assuming an enormous amount based on what is available to our senses. What if we -- meaning dance researchers -- are simply projecting a whole lot of 

Embodied knowledge: knowledge held in or by the body. To communicate it we must disembody it. But if disembodied where does it reside? In 

Add how Ingold refutes this idea of 'holding'. (and Sheets-Johnstone)

from Choinere quote:

three abstract terms in one sentence 
somatic intelligence is subset of physical intelligence?
somatic intelligence as heightened sensitivity: but more than who? 
I don't get the 'increased' bit. 
what are the other forms? 
to sense what? to perceive what?
to relate to whom or what?

no attempt  And if I stop and think about what she might mean by "increased skill" when it comes to any form of intelligence it seems as if us dance scholars are desperate to make features out of bugs.

But what about _embodied actions_ or _embodied movements_ or even _embodied dance_? These are all terms common in dance practice and scholarship. Actions, movements and dance are concepts that are already primarily corporeal, at least in their common usage. It's as if in these examples the word _embodied_ acts as an adjectival modifier to help make the nouns more specific, not unlike _fast_ or _hot_ or _sexy_. As in fast actions, hot movements and sexy dance. But with _embodied_ as a modifier of human action this does not seem quite right. I suspect that when we describe an action as _embodied_ we are ascribing some quality of attention or awareness to that action. That such embodied actions are not trivially placed on the outside of the body, but rather invested deeply within the body. The question of how it is that we might recognise embodied actions over what I could call _disembodied actions_ is an entirely different problem. (Sheets-Johnston 2011 discusses disembodiment)

That was a question that occurred to us early in the practice. add here about reading Zuboff. A coincidence. 

I was reading Zuboff then but it seemed to chime with ideas about individuation. But later, while still reading her (I am indeed a slow reader) ... datafication. (for a different project).

I make no claims about the uniqueness of the practice itself.

Except one experiment with music when Shaun had what can only be described as a bad trip. 

did nothing at all seemingly related nearly as fancy or smart as Weckert or Zuboff. Nor did we do anything that seems to be related. Authentic movement.

It doesn't matter how this dance is recorded, how this dance ends up online or even on this screen, there exists a remarkable -- and remarkably beautiful -- gap in resolution between the dance and its digitally recorded other. This gap is not about how it looks, the shapes in space, the timings, the gradations and articulations of joints, even the tone of muscles: the very very many things that make up the dancing body. Yes, the dancing is performative, a digital version formative. And that gap in resolution ...

Not something lost, something missing. 

, in reality, formative, rather than performative. s so true that our wildly and radically analogue bodies are performative, and capable of performance. It's not that this dance is performative, but also that it's formative. 

Divert here into a few brief notes on embodied knowledge. Wikipedia: diverts to tacit knowledge. List here from that one article of various terms that could arguably mean the same (or similar) thing. The lack of precision is chronically characteristic of so much dance scholarship that discusses embodied knowledge. 

worth glenna Batson's thinking? 

Mention Emma's idea: 

>I think for me that at the root of it is the counterpart of dissociation, ie splitting from body experience often caused by trauma. Not sure that’s much help. I do think embodiment exists and its not just having a body but very hard to point to it via language.

and asked myself how it might help understand the discrepanci And it was by robbing de Sousa Santos of his thinking for one context (that of higher and lower resolution levels between theories and methods) that I tore the term _resolution_ from one context and linked it together 

although perhaps if I were really desperate I might make some claims about the inappropriately clumsy role of the smartphone in the practice.
