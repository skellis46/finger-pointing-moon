>The rendition of your body begins quite simply with your phone. [@zuboff_age_2019]

- turn off phones: create the opposite. a little black hole. an absence. a silence. it's just us. untracked for 15 minutes. bliss. going dark. create a wild space. like the body. a wild space: unpredictable and inextractable. a place for our analogue selves. our radically analogue bodies. where something is not simply yes or no, this or that, 1 or 0, anything but boolean, untouched, untouchable. that resists the facts and fictions of sampling, the logic of data. the datafication of the world, the ideology of data.  it is wild space of feelings. those things that underpin all conversations, all experiences. nuanced, primitive, primal. All that we are saying, all that we are hearing, all that we are communicating and proposing, is underpinned by feelings: 

"conversations do not just involve feelings, they are at their very core about feelings" [@stone_difficult_2003 p.13]

to feel smart, to feel less clumsy, to feel busy, to avoid the fear of failure, to feel wanted or needed, to feel successful, to be repelled by ambition, to feel less lonely, to be respected, valued, loved even. To feel superior, less inferior, to feel astonished, eager, energetic, confused, excited, significant or insignificant. the wild spaces of our analogue bodies understand these things. I am never just this or that, never just busy or needy, nor superior or inferior. and with all these feelings, all these states and traits we are all dancing. they are dances of self-loathing, dances of love and laughter, dances of patience and care, dances of pride and pleasure, dances of honesty and lies. Who are you if there's nothing wrong with you? 

- we are here together, in this dark space, with our wild bodies, our wildly and radically analogue bodies, untracked, and unpredictable. 
- [dance - for camera] 

- it doesn't matter how this dance is recorded, how this dance ends up online or even on this screen, there exists a remarkable and remarkably beautiful gap in resolution between the dance and its digital other. this gap is not about how it looks, the shapes in space, the timings, the gradations and articulations of joints, even the tone of muscles: the very very many things that make up the dancing body
- it's not so much that our wildly and radically analogue bodies are performative. 
- it's formative.
