# Corporeal epistemics

_The background:_ 

In 2017 _The Economist_ declared that the "world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data".[^1] We are unwitting pawns in a silent data war, and the algorithms of Google and Facebook are winning. This is the age of _surveillance capitalism_, founded on "extractive operations in which our personal experiences are scraped and packaged as the means to others’ ends".[^2] Dance and the performing arts are likewise beholden to the data-fication of experience: the online archive, digital documentation, virtual reality ... After all, like moths to a flame, we follow the money in order to survive.

_The foreground:_  

In the European summer of 2019 the choreographer-dancer Shaun McLeod (Australia) and I worked for four weeks in a studio in London. We worked with simple materials: Authentic Movement, a camera and each other. We did not produce a work or outcome to be seen, but rather ended up exploring the nature of things that cannot be described. If the key epistemic question is "who, when, why is constructing knowledges?"[^3] then in this presentation I will attempt to discuss the epistemic _why_ of experiences that are unable to be discussed. They are experiences of politics and humility that underpin the radically analogue nature of the human body; they are experiences that exceed "algorithmic description";[^4] perhaps they are even experiences or _acts_ of "epistemic disobedience".[^5]


## Biography 

Simon Ellis is an artist working with practices of choreography, filmmaking and dance. He was born in the Wairarapa in Aotearoa/New Zealand, but now lives in London and works at C-DaRE. He is a Pākehā — a white person of European descent – and grew up in a family where politicised conversations about equality, consumerism and even technology were common. These conversations have shaped his values as an artist, and underpin much of what his practice is about, and how it is conducted. He also thinks about the ways humans might value things that are not easily commodified, and likes to imagine a world filled with people who are sensitive to their own bodies, and the bodies of others.

## Presentation details

- (Un)conventional presentation (15-20 minutes)
- require video projection and audio from my computer (2015 MacBook Pro with HDMI or mini-display ports). I will need to use my computer (as opposed to a shared laptop) as I will build the presentation 'live' using various applications on my machine.
- I also require information about the possible resolutions of the monitor/projector in the conference room.
