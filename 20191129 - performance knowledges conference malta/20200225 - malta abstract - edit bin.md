- am I describing or imagining the limits of tech? the directionality of this quote is odd in context of this research

research is fundamentally about noticing change. that we understand something differently as a consequence of spending time with it. could be intervention, could be a phenomenon. caveat that noticing no change is something as well.

Yet even given the vagaries and ambiguities of doing embodied research that yields embodied knowledge, t

I'm going to abandon the term _embody_ (or any of its constructions) now. I suggest you try it. It's like being let off some crazy circular train that has no stops.

I wonder if we can we all agree that there was embodied knowledge in that laboratory dance space? But this in itself is an absurd question. I mean when is there not embodied knowledge in any room? It's here now. We don't have to be moving. So, do we then mean a certain level or quantity of embodied knowledge? Is there some kind of threshold when embodied knowledge becomes useful or noticeable? Or when we use the term 'embodied research' do we just mean research that focuses on the body by people with bodies trained and sensitised to the complexities of the moving, sensing body? Perhaps I am being provocatively simplistic or stubborn here but sometimes it sure feels as if that embodied emperor isn't wearing any clothes; not that I'd want to point that out.

proxy of embodied knowledge devalues rich experiences that are unable to be discussed. Sheets-Johnstone and Ingold. finger pointing moon.

relate 'the truth' to OED definition of embodied.

Ben Spatz recently advertised a workshop in which he describes ... 
Journal of Embodied Research.
Does that mean all the other journals only handle disembodied research? 

But the clincher is that we assuming an enormous amount based on what is available to our senses. What if we -- meaning dance researchers -- are simply projecting a whole lot of 

Embodied knowledge: knowledge held in or by the body. To communicate it we must disembody it. But if disembodied where does it reside? In 

Add how Ingold refutes this idea of 'holding'. (and Sheets-Johnstone)

from Choinere quote:

three abstract terms in one sentence 
somatic intelligence is subset of physical intelligence?
somatic intelligence as heightened sensitivity: but more than who? 
I don't get the 'increased' bit. 
what are the other forms? 
to sense what? to perceive what?
to relate to whom or what?

no attempt  And if I stop and think about what she might mean by "increased skill" when it comes to any form of intelligence it seems as if us dance scholars are desperate to make features out of bugs.

But what about _embodied actions_ or _embodied movements_ or even _embodied dance_? These are all terms common in dance practice and scholarship. Actions, movements and dance are concepts that are already primarily corporeal, at least in their common usage. It's as if in these examples the word _embodied_ acts as an adjectival modifier to help make the nouns more specific, not unlike _fast_ or _hot_ or _sexy_. As in fast actions, hot movements and sexy dance. But with _embodied_ as a modifier of human action this does not seem quite right. I suspect that when we describe an action as _embodied_ we are ascribing some quality of attention or awareness to that action. That such embodied actions are not trivially placed on the outside of the body, but rather invested deeply within the body. The question of how it is that we might recognise embodied actions over what I could call _disembodied actions_ is an entirely different problem. (Sheets-Johnston 2011 discusses disembodiment)

That was a question that occurred to us early in the practice. add here about reading Zuboff. A coincidence. 

I was reading Zuboff then but it seemed to chime with ideas about individuation. But later, while still reading her (I am indeed a slow reader) ... datafication. (for a different project).

I make no claims about the uniqueness of the practice itself.

Except one experiment with music when Shaun had what can only be described as a bad trip. 

did nothing at all seemingly related nearly as fancy or smart as Weckert or Zuboff. Nor did we do anything that seems to be related. Authentic movement.

It doesn't matter how this dance is recorded, how this dance ends up online or even on this screen, there exists a remarkable -- and remarkably beautiful -- gap in resolution between the dance and its digitally recorded other. This gap is not about how it looks, the shapes in space, the timings, the gradations and articulations of joints, even the tone of muscles: the very very many things that make up the dancing body. Yes, the dancing is performative, a digital version formative. And that gap in resolution ...

Not something lost, something missing. 

, in reality, formative, rather than performative. s so true that our wildly and radically analogue bodies are performative, and capable of performance. It's not that this dance is performative, but also that it's formative. 

Divert here into a few brief notes on embodied knowledge. Wikipedia: diverts to tacit knowledge. List here from that one article of various terms that could arguably mean the same (or similar) thing. The lack of precision is chronically characteristic of so much dance scholarship that discusses embodied knowledge. 

worth glenna Batson's thinking? 

Mention Emma's idea: 

>I think for me that at the root of it is the counterpart of dissociation, ie splitting from body experience often caused by trauma. Not sure that’s much help. I do think embodiment exists and its not just having a body but very hard to point to it via language.

and asked myself how it might help understand the discrepanci And it was by robbing de Sousa Santos of his thinking for one context (that of higher and lower resolution levels between theories and methods) that I tore the term _resolution_ from one context and linked it together 

although perhaps if I were really desperate I might make some claims about the inappropriately clumsy role of the smartphone in the practice.
