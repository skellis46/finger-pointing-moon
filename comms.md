Dear James 

Thanks Scott for the introduction.

James, I am indeed exploring the ways in which collections of (cross-disciplinary) images and texts might reveal the limits, margins and possibilities of human understanding and experience of the body; a way of addressing what is known, able to be known, and what remains unknown about visual and sensorial experiences of the human body. 

These are ideas which, as you can imagine, are intrinsically interesting to people involved in dance as an art form. But my curiosity is more about the intersections of arts and science practices, and what these intersections might suggest or provoke for the wider public.

I'd certainly be keen to have conversation with you if these ideas seem interesting or useful to you.

Thanks for your time, and best wishes.

Simon



Dear Josh

It was really great to meet last week. Thanks for your interest and openness. 

This email is a (rather long) follow-up to our conversation:

1. Here is a tiny sample of the kinds of materials I think might be part of the work: https://www.skellis.net/unknowable. They aren't organised at all, and it's a little arbitrary, but perhaps this is a little less abstract? I plan to add to these as I continue to develop the funding bid -- to help the conversations with potential project partners. 

2. The Arts and Humanities Research Council (the body I am applying to) says a lot (too much) about project partner support letters. I've included various notes from their guidelines at the bottom of this email. 

3. We discussed possible dates as being later summer/autumn (March -- ?) 2023.

4. Pragmatic things like:
- scale: how many square meters? I've estimated 20-40 "items" per square meter - approx
- where to install at Dancehouse? Could it fill all walls in the entrance space for instance? (ie large scale -- as if immersed in these ideas)
- installation costs? 
- my thought is that I would send the physical materials as a single collection. Consider when/how to return (and uninstall)?
- how long installed?
- maintenance?
- any costs not able to be covered by Dancehouse? (and that I would need to budget for)

5. Local artists curating/organising

- we discussed possibility of local artists 'making sense' of the materials and spending time with them to decide how they might be organised and installed
- possibility of engaging local artists to respond directly to the installation? This might be written, or it could be performed/developed ...

6. Public programme of events
- what might this be? 
- I'm very open to any number of ideas depending on your plans and vision for Dancehouse.

7. Other versions
- am thinking of budgeting to have the materials recorded so an audio version would exist online
- also possibly an entirely digital archive of the materials

That's it for now Josh. Do you have any questions for me at this stage? 

I think the next steps are to: a) keep thinking through pragmatics; b) start thinking through the content of the support letter. 

There's no hurry though.

Very best to you.

Simon




# Project Partner Letter of Support - details

- Each Project Partner must provide a letter of support to provide assurance that the project partner has authorised the proposed contribution or commitment. 
- No more than 2 x A4 pages
- targeted specifically towards the whole research project (and also the installation specifically) - this will mean I will send you an overview of the entire project (closer to the end of the year)
- Clearly explain the value, relevance and possible benefits of the work to the project partner;
- Give the nature and equivalent value of any in-kind contribution, and/or declare the value of a cash contribution, and period of support;
- Describe the added value to the project of the project partner’s involvement.
- The letter should be dated and should be written when the proposal is being prepared. A standard letter declaring support for the proposed work is not helpful.

- plan for disseminating/communications
- how might your audiences benefit from this work? (who are these audiences)
- economic benefits? quality of life benefits? potential way of thinking about how your organisation works and with whom? 
- why did you say “yes”? 
- presented work like this before? anything 
- this is about instrumentality of the research

Long details:
- The letter of support is intended provide reassurance to the AHRC and to its reviewers that the appropriate authorisation has been given to the proposed contribution or commitment from a collaborating organisation. To provide assurance that the project partner has authorised the proposed contribution or commitment the letter or email should be signed by the named contact, stating the capacity in which they are providing the sign off. Project Partner letters of support that merely indicate that an organisation is interested in the research are not permitted. 
A well written project partner letter of support will confirm the organisation’s commitment to the proposed project by articulating the benefits of the collaboration, its relevance and potential impact. The Project Partner letter should also identify the value, relevance and possible benefits of the proposed work to the partner, the period of support, the full nature of the collaboration/support and how the partner will provide added value. Where relevant to the project, details should be provided of the projected market size, customers and sales and how the organisation will commercialise the technology beyond the project. Project Partner contributions, whether in cash or in kind, should be explained in detail in the project partner letter of support. 


# unforgettable: a proposal

'Unforgettable' is an art project by choreographer Simon Ellis made up of a collection of hand-crafted letters that each describe a single unforgettable moment or experience of dance or dancing. Here's an example:

"It's 2005. I'm in the middle of lots of bodies. The music is loud. The room is sweating. I feel as if the movement is happening to me, and that I couldn't stop it even if I wanted to: moving, sweating, moving, dancing." - anonymous, USA.

Here's another:

"I saw a dance performance by Helen Herbertson and Ben Cobham, but don't remember the name of the work. It must have been around 1997. All I remember is the feeling that my life was now different; that I saw things differently ... that I understood how limited our time is on Earth." - SB, Melbourne.

'Unforgettable' will be part of a larger dance research project called 'Finger Pointing Moon' planned to start in 2022.  

Simon is looking for possible project partners around the world who might be interested in hosting the exhibition (or who are affiliated to dance or art spaces that could host it) and perhaps helping to create a small series of activities around the exhibition. 




# unforgettable letter

Hello

My name is Simon Ellis and I am a dancer. 

I want to invite you to contribute to an art project called _unforgettable_. The project is an exhibition made up of a collection of hand-crafted messages that each describe a single unforgettable moment or experience of dance or dancing. My hope is that the project will become a growing catalogue of a global community's experiences of dance.

You can contribute your _unforgettable experience of dance_ in one of two ways:

1. Email me directly at simon.ellis@coventry.ac.uk. 

2. Hand write your response and post it directly to me at:

Simon Ellis
70 Rocks Lane
Barnes 
SW13 0DA
UK

Please write in any language (it will be presented in that language). Your message might only be a sentence, or it might have more detail. It is also up to you if you'd prefer to include your name and where it is that you call home.

If you'd like to be kept informed about the project (and where and when it will happen) just let me know and include some way of contacting you.

Thank you so much for your time and please do share this letter with people you are close to. 

Simon



It's 1995. I'm in the middle of lots of bodies. The music is loud. The room is sweating. I feel as if the movement is happening to me, and that I couldn't stop it even if I wanted to: moving, sweating, moving, dancing.

In Ed Snowden's autobiography called Permanent Record he writes about the idea of an unforgettable experience:

>Here’s what strikes me when I think back to my childhood, particularly those first nine Internet-less years ... “the unforgettable experience” was not yet a threateningly literal technological description, but a passionate metaphorical prescription of significance: my first words, my first steps, my first lost tooth, my first time riding a bicycle.

Dear Josh

I think we might know each other from a long way back – back when I was based in Melbourne (I’m now in London, and have been more or less since 2006). 

I imagine it’s still pretty strange in Melbourne at the moment (as it is here) so perhaps this is a particularly bad time for a cold call type email. It’s about an idea for a simple installation (perhaps for the foyer at Dancehouse?). 

I'm putting together a funding proposal to the UK’s Arts and Humanities Research Council for a "Research, Development and Engagement" Fellowship. It's a long process, and I plan to submit the proposal by Feb 2021 and look to start the 18 month project in Feb 2022.

Below is an idea for a simple installation that I thought might interest you and the community at Dancehouse (around late 2022 or early 2023?)

At this stage I'm looking for people, organisations and spaces who are potentially interested in presenting the work. This would involve becoming a project partner for the funding bid. Partnering an AHRC bid needn't be complex (and nor would being involved in the project cost Dancehouse money on top of regular operating budget), but it will involve a bit of initial toing and froing and a reasonably detailed and carefully worded support letter. In terms of timings, I need to get project partners sorted out by the end of this year.

Thanks Josh, and very best wishes.

_the un/knowable body: an exhibition of the ways humans think, feel, and understand the moving body_

The idea is to develop and curate an exhibition comprised of a collection of found/researched printed materials. These materials would contain and present a wide range of ideas, images, histories, knowledges, myths, concepts, understandings and misunderstandings of and about the moving human body.

The form of the exhibition is in part inspired by Olafur Eliasson's _Installation view_ at the "In real life" exhibition at Tate Modern in 2019. Here are two images from that work: <https://www.skellis.net/blog/installation-view>.

The materials in _the un/knowable body_ would be organised or curated so as to provoke surprising connections across the images and texts -- to bring together and expand the certainties and uncertainties of our understanding and experiences of the moving human body.

It's a simple idea, easily installed and presented. But it's also an idea filled with the possibilities, limitations and complexities of how we understand our moving bodies.

# 2. unforgettable

I'm interested in developing and curating an installation comprised of hand-written letters collected from people all around the world. Each of these letters would detail a single unforgettable personal moment or experience of dance -- whether doing, watching or making it.

Here's some background:  

At the beginning of 2020 I read Ed Snowden's autobiography called Permanent Record. Here's something he says about the concept of an unforgettable experience:

>Here’s what strikes me when I think back to my childhood, particularly those first nine Internet-less years: I can’t account for everything that happened back then, because I have only my memory to rely on. The data just doesn’t exist. When I was a child, “the unforgettable experience” was not yet a threateningly literal technological description, but a passionate metaphorical prescription of significance: my first words, my first steps, my first lost tooth, my first time riding a bicycle. (Chapter 1: Looking Through the Window)

In a digital world in which our experiences can no longer be "unforgettable" this project would be entirely analogue: the communications, the paper, the pens, the installation itself. It would be an attempt to catalogue a global community's unforgettable experiences of dance.

unforgettable experiences in dance: a project proposal

Dear Wieke

I trust you are keeping well and that Yorkshire Dance is finding a way through these strange and discombobulating CV-19 times.

When we last had a brief email exchange I hinted at a project proposal that I thought might interest you. Here goes ...

I'm putting together a funding proposal to the Arts and Humanities Research Council for a "Research, Development and Engagement" Fellowship. It's a long process, and I plan to submit the proposal by Feb 2021 and look to start the 18 month project in Feb 2022.

Perhaps the first question is, does this interest you?

If yes, perhaps we can talk about what this might mean for Yorkshire Dance. Partnering an AHRC bid needn't be complex (and nor would it need to cost YD money on top of regular operating budget), but it will involve a bit of toing and froing. In terms of timings, I need to get project partners sorted out by the end of this year. 

Thanks Wieke, and I look forward to your response.

Simon







The fellowship is designed to include a period of research and a strong developmental component. For the research component I plan to look at and practice a number of things to do with what the body "knows" and how those understandings are communicated. The developmental component is focused on communicating
