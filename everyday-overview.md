# Finger pointing moon: recognising change through practice-research

## Background

This document is a brief overview of my plans for an 18 month AHRC Research, Development and Engagement Fellowship (working 2.5 days per week). These fellowships consist of two distinct (but potentially overlapping) components: 

_a) research:_ "to carry out high-quality individual research which has the potential to generate a significant impact on their discipline";[^rfg]

_b) development:_ to enhance the researcher's skillset "to extend their expertise into new research areas or to engage with non-academic audiences".[^rfg]

[^rfg]: <https://ahrc.ukri.org/funding/research/researchfundingguide/> Version 5.1

My proposal is to: a) conduct some primary research to investigate the limits of what we can know or understand through practice-research; and b) develop my communication practices and skills with non-academic audiences.

## Two definitions

1. practice-research: an umbrella term for artists working within the academy who use their arts practice as a research method. It is also known as artistic research. This kind of research produces non-traditional research outputs like films, performances, experimental texts, compositions, etc. 
2. epistemology: the philosophical study of knowledge. The question, "_how_ do you know _that_ you know _what_ you know?" is a tongue-twisting summary of epistemological work. 

Practice-research has an understandably _tricky_ relationship with epistemology. If the commonly held purpose of research is to generate insights and understandings, then when an artist _does_ research by making art, what and how are new understandings (or knowledge) created, and how are they communicated and shared? 

## The Research Component

Practice-research has two fundamental epistemic questions: 1) What is known or understood differently as a consequence of practice-research methods? 2) How might these understandings be shared and articulated? The second question has been examined in detail through research into documentation and archives. However, for nearly 30 years the first question has remained practice-research's most controversial and under-examined. The aim of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is to tackle this first fundamental epistemic question. 

The project's aim is underpinned by three epistemic conditions: i) _proxies_, in which artist-scholars rely on epistemic proxies to circumvent the messiness of noticing change (that is, acquiring knowledge or observing ways in which "our seeing, our expectations, and our thinking"[@noe_strange_2015, Chapter 11, n.p.] are reorganised) in practice-research; ii) _limits_, in which artist-scholars fail to examine the limits of what can and cannot be known through practice-research; and iii) _hyper-specificity_, in which practice-research understandings and methods are rarely in critical dialogue with each other. 

_Finger Pointing Moon_ has three research questions built on these conditions:

1. _Proxies_: What are practice-research's common epistemic proxies and how does their presence affect the value of practice-research as an approach to understanding the ambiguous and complex experiences of human artistic endeavour? 

2. _Limits:_ What are the epistemic limits of practice-research? What aspects of practices are not able to be known, understood or articulated?

3. _Hyper-specificity_: What language is used to express findings and failures in practice-research? How might this language be adapted in order to create increased critical dialogue between practice-research artist-scholars?

## The development component

This aspect of the project is relatively underdeveloped. What I hope to do is create strategies for communicating the value of something that appears to have little value outside of a small sub-group of academics. This would have two (rather obvious) components: a) understanding what that value is; b) attempting to communicate it to people inside and outside the Academy.

Here's climate change activist Jim Bendell:

>we can be clearer about the kinds of actions that are useful to describe as “leadership” rather than something else, like “management” or “organising”. Leadership actions are those that help shift the way groups, networks or whole communities of people relate and so such actions generate effects over time. [@bendell_leadership_2019]

Of course in this research I'm not working with something as urgent as climate change but Bendell's thinking got me wondering about the nature of _communities_ and _action_. 

I've also been thinking about processes of individuation (relating to solitude) versus individualism (which is really the opposite of what Bendell is describing above). Perhaps another way to consider this in the personal development aspect of the project is a tension between solitude and the collective. That I might develop a speculative _wildcard_ solitude practice (after all, it is through practices that we come to understand things) of, for instance, one hour per day in solitude and silence: "doubts, or questions, or even just difficulties ... can only be found within -- without distractions, without peer pressure, in solitude".[@deresiewicz_solitude_2010] 

This tension -- between processes of individuation and community development (and communications development) -- might be productive in thinking through the _developmental_ component of the proposal. 

## The outputs[^nomethods]

[^nomethods]: You'll note here that I've avoided discussing the research methods. This is because they felt less relevant to this initial conversation. 

The following are a list of possible outputs. They are divided into four categories based on the three research problems above, and a fourth _whole project_ category. Each output is also coded as being a research component (RES) and/or a development component (DEV). 
I've been playfully and excessively ambitious in thinking of these possible outputs, and recognise it might simply be too much!

A key question that underpins many of these outputs is how do non-academics benefit from this work? 

_1. proxies_

- OUTPUT 1: journal article on epistemic proxies (_RES_)

_2. limits_

- OUTPUT 2: authentic movement: speculative and/or experimental documentation practices through writing and still and moving images (_RES_)
- OUTPUT 3: third-person scholarly article [2] about epistemic limits 
    + possibly in collaboration with Katherine Hawley, Anna Pakes, or Alva Noë (_RES_)
- OUTPUT 4: _Unforgettable_ exhibition (_DEV_)
- OUTPUT 5: _The Un/knowable Body_ exhibition (_DEV_)

_3. hyper-specificity_

- OUTPUT 6: lexicon of epistemological "findings and failures" (_RES_)
    + something like the [emotion wheel](https://www.skellis.net/blog/emotions)
    + lexicon: the vocabulary of a person, language, or branch of knowledge

_4. whole project_

These outputs should address (in some form) the overall aim of the project.[^aim] 

[^aim]: Can this aim allude to key developmental aspect of communicating complex abstract research or is that separate to the 'research'? This is not at all clear in the AHRC guidelines.

- OUTPUT 7: video essay: collates and articulates key concerns/findings of project (_RES_)
- OUTPUT 8: 8-10 podcasts (transcribed) (_DEV_)
    + List of experts that might be involved: Vida Midgelow, Paul Magee, Harmony Bench (scepticism), Rachel Hann, Henk Borgdorff, Erik Knudsen, Katherine Hawley, look at [PRAG group](https://prag-uk.org/), 
    + Possible interviews with wider public? Why might this research matter to someone not involved in this specialist area? 
    + [School of Life](https://www.theschooloflife.com/)? -- great model for making philsophy accessible 
    + Someone from [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/)? 

- OUTPUT 9: public discourse forum: a site for students, potential students, artist-researchers, other disciplines; create with group of people from around the world: look to get 50-100 active users in first year (_DEV_)
    + plan for maintenance and sustainability
    + could use platform like [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) or [Substack](https://substack.com/)
- OUTPUT 10: 5 curated talks online (micro-conferences) (_DEV_)
    + e.g. [lesswrong.com/posts/9m9SniwdKsKyfjrMw/inviting-curated-authors-to-give-5-min-online-talks](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9m9SniwdKsKyfjrMw/inviting-curated-authors-to-give-5-min-online-talks)
    + these could be held by people who have contributed to the project blog or the podcasts? 
- OUTPUT 11: article for The Conversation (_RES / DEV_)
- OUTPUT 12: project website and blog (_RES_)
- OUTPUT 13: github site (radical transparency) (_DEV_)
    + basically a downloadable version of all texts from the website
    + currently at <https://github.com/skellis46/finger-pointing-moon>
