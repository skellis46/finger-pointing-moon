>from Je-S help:

>Project Partners

>Details should be given of project partners and their contributions. An organisation should only be named as a project partner if it is providing specific contributions (either direct or indirect) to the research project.

>Research Councils will pay Research Councils' % contribution of the total costs of the project excluding the project partner contribution. Project partner contributions in cash or in-kind should be seen as additional to the Research Councils' % contribution and are not considered part of the fEC of the project. BBSRC operates an exception for Industrial Partnership Awards (see BBSRC Research Grants Guide for details).

>Attach a letter to the proposal (attachment type "letter of support") from each partner.

>The content of the letter should:

>Confirm commitment to the proposed project;
Clearly explain the value, relevance and possible benefits of the work to the project partner;
Give the nature and equivalent value of any in-kind contribution, and/or declare the value of a cash contribution, and period of support; and
Describe the added value to the project of the project partner’s involvement.
The letter should be dated and should be written when the proposal is being prepared. The letter should be targeted specifically to the project. A standard letter declaring support for the proposed work is not helpful.

They are not going to be ‘employed’ but rather can only be ‘helicoptored’ in and out swiftly for brief moments.) -- Bob Whalley

subject: dance improvisation research project

Dear 

My name is Simon Ellis and I'm a dance artist and researcher based at the Centre for Dance Research, Coventry University. My work explores the nature of improvisation in dance, and experimental methods of documenting ephemeral artistic practices and experiences.

This email is about a research project and funding bid – called Finger Pointing Moon - that is designed to explore what we can know and say about the practice of dancing. 

I've long being interested in your work on the nature of expertise, and the way it includes people and is able to find audiences outside of disciplinary boundaries. 

Would you be interested in being involved in the studio-based 'fieldwork' of the Finger Pointing Moon as a outside observer? Your role would be to provide 'expert input' on what you are seeing and noticing as you watch two people wrestle with the flow-like state of 'being present'. 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely.
