- expert input (from Amy: and it is in minute amounts (this is a fellowship after all) AHRC will not be too rattled; and more important that you can clearly justify the necessary need. They are not going to be ‘employed’ but rather can only be ‘helicoptored’ in and out swiftly for brief moments.) -- Bob Whalley

subject: dance improvisation research project

Dear 

My name is Simon Ellis and I'm a dance artist and researcher based at the Centre for Dance Research, Coventry University. My work explores the nature of improvisation in dance, and experimental methods of documenting ephemeral artistic practices and experiences.

This email is about a research project and funding bid – called Finger Pointing Moon - that is designed to explore what we can know and say about the practice of dancing. 

I've long being interested in your work on the nature of expertise, and the way it includes people and is able to find audiences outside of disciplinary boundaries. 

Would you be interested in being involved in the studio-based 'fieldwork' of the Finger Pointing Moon as a outside observer? Your role would be to provide 'expert input' on what you are seeing and noticing as you watch two people wrestle with the flow-like state of 'being present'. 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely.
