# project partners, impact and engagement

_purpose_
- what am I trying to achieve? 
    + inspiring/informing
    + collaborative engagement (work together to make decisions)
    + how might this understanding/knowledge be applied? how might it be useful to your organisation and your audiences? 
    + I want to learn from you: about your audiences, to help me see this work through their eyes (this could be through dialogue -- stories, consultation)
- who is it for?
- what might you as a partner be wanting to achieve? 


- sharing with public
- two-way process: interaction and listening. What we do and why?
- connect universities with society
- collaborative research
- participatory arts
- community engagement
- engagement with partners
- enrich focus, clarity and relevance of research
- animated by co-production, partnership, dialogue

- _aim of activity?_ - public experiences, interest, inspire
- _objectives:_ what do I want to know? 
- _partners:_ communities of interest <--> general public
- dialogues -- open-ended
- public good


- _evaluation_: Evaluation is a valuable tool that enables you to learn from your experiences and to assess the impact of your work.
- inform the development of project 
- assess if objectives met
- what changed as a result of the activity
- how it could have been more effective
- any unintended outcomes (both positive and negative). 
- It is important to understand not only what happened but also why something worked or didn't work.

- _evaluation plan:_
    1. overarching aim of activity
    2. objectives (SMART!)
    3. questions: what do I want to know? 
    4. methods: quantitative and qualitative 
    5. data collection:
        * basic numbers of participants
        * questionnaire: thoughts/feelings/experiences/new ideas/reminded of anything
        * interviews
        * video diaries
        * focus groups
    6. data analysis: e.g. GLOs (see below) -- a type of coding framework
    7. reporting

## my public engagement programme

To carry out and disseminate research that can inform and enrich partner programme, place and practices. To support partner (and stakeholders) to become more connected to research, with deeper understanding of the limits of understanding of the human body.


### unforgettable: connects our memory of dancing with our knowledge of dancing


- _Current situation - A description of the situation you are trying to change_: a form without memory (archives are of the things/events, very rarely if at all about experiences of the things inside and out). 
- _aims:_ To create a shared recollection/memory of experiences of dancing that inspires and creates interest in the form. To develop understanding of ...; to establish a way of collaborating between researchers, partners, stakeholders (artists) and wider public; something about learning?

>Learning is a process of active engagement with experience. It is what people do when they want to make sense of the world. It may involve the development or deepening of skills, knowledge, understanding, awareness, values, ideas and feelings, or an increase in the capacity to reflect. Effective learning leads to change, development and the desire to learn more.

- _inputs (what I will contribute):_ 
- _activities (what am going to do to achieve aims):_
    + what if I brought in Jason Maling to work with group of artists at Dancehouse? -- Jason?  Should the artists be paid for participating? 
- _outputs (what I create):_
- _outcomes (what happens as a result):_

### the un/knowing body: connects what is known with what is not known about the moving human body

_The Un/knowable Body_ directly explores a key part of the research component of _Finger Pointing Moon_ by addressing what is able to be known -- and what remains unknown -- about visual and sensorial experiences of the human body. 

- _Current situation - A description of the situation you are trying to change_: body as machine ??? (see [evmed.asu.edu/blog/body-not-machine](https://evmed.asu.edu/blog/body-not-machine)) imaging techniques, broken, fix, mechanical, input-output
- _aims:_ To develop understanding of the invisible, experiential, richly varied understandings of the moving body, inspires and creates interest in the body as sensing and fuzzy organism. Bringing into view that which cannot be seen. Intangible, hard to pin-down experiences. To develop understanding of ...; to establish a way of collaborating between researchers, partners, stakeholders (artists) and wider public; something about learning?

## notes for rk meeting

- a bit about me
- dance research project called FPM
- building a funding bid for AHRC "research, development and engagement fellowship"
- broadly about the limits of understanding, and how dance practice might help us think about these limits. Here's something I wrote:
>We can agree that dancers have some kind of knowledge of what they are doing; that they _know how_ to do what they are doing. But it's not easy to understand or describe what it means to know something in dance. We might use a word like 'embodied' to describe the way a dancer-in-their-body seems to know something, but this isn't necessarily very helpful. For example, how would we recognise a disembodied dancer? _Finger Pointing Moon_ is a dance research project about what it means to know through and in our moving bodies.
- authentic movement: experimental dance practice, 
- AM is a process-oriented movement practice that distinguishes the body as observed from the outside (third-person perspective) and the soma as perceived from the inside (first-person perception).[@hanna_what_1995 p.341] 
- simple (two people: doer and watcher) non-judgement, practice of attention and awareness, like pure presence or flow; not made to be watched, so not dealing with overtly large or virtuosic dancing. Two worlds: the visible or those things able to be seen or observed (might even say "empirical"); the invisible -- the rich world of experiential, imagination, etc (the "slippery"). 
- 1st person (mover), 3rd person (doer) perspectives (loosely)
- my thought was that your experience and expertise as an observer of people 'at work' (but coming from very different background) might enrich this aspect of the research. You'd provide a 2nd and wider angle 3rd person perspective observing both the watcher and the doer. A step removed, but also inside: noticing that which can be seen, and recognising (perhaps) that which cannot.

## email to rk

subject: dance improvisation research project

Dear 

My name is Simon Ellis and I'm a dance artist and researcher based at the Centre for Dance Research, Coventry University. My work explores the nature of improvisation in dance, and experimental methods of documenting ephemeral artistic practices and experiences.

This email is about a research project and funding bid – called Finger Pointing Moon - that is designed to explore what we can know and say about the practice of dancing. 

I've long being interested in your work on the nature of expertise, and the way it includes people and is able to find audiences outside of disciplinary boundaries. 

Would you be interested in being involved in the studio-based 'fieldwork' of the Finger Pointing Moon as a outside observer? Your role would be to provide 'expert input' on what you are seeing and noticing as you watch two people wrestle with the flow-like state of 'being present'. 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely.


## plain-language email re the un/knowing body

Dear Josh

It occurs to me that my last email likely blind-sided you with a whole heap of 'stuff'. I want to apologise for this. What follows is an attempt to describe my project far more plainly, and to outline some ideas that might help shape the work together. I can do as much of the labour as possible (including drafting the letter), but I just need some information from you how you see this idea best serving you and your community (or parts of it). This email is longer than I'd like, but at least there are no attachments! 

Here goes ... 

We can agree that dancers have some kind of knowledge of what they are doing; that they _know how_ to do what they are doing. But it's not easy to understand or describe what it means to know something in dance. We might use a word like 'embodied' to describe the way a dancer-in-their-body seems to know something, but this isn't necessarily very helpful. For example, how would we recognise a disembodied dancer? _Finger Pointing Moon_ is a dance research project about what it means to know through and in our moving bodies. 

I am proposing to you a part of this project which I've called _the un/knowing body_. It gets at the problem of knowing in dance by gathering a large range of visual and written materials that will likely fall along a continuum -- from facts about the body (mostly gathered through scientific understandings) to much more slippery ideas about the body: feelings, experiences, even the nature of embodiment itself. In this way it connects what is known with what is not known about the moving human body. I will collect these materials, organise them a little bit, and then give them to you at Dancehouse to work with in some way. This might be about a series of workshops with them, an installation, a web-page, or something else -- whatever you think best serves your community's needs and interests. I am happy to be as involved (or uninvolved) as you would prefer, but I do wonder to what extent we might work together to make decisions through some kind of collaborative engagement.

What I'm hoping to achieve with _the un/knowing body_ is to inspire and inform people about how much and how little we know about the moving body. I am interested to find out how this idea -- and the materials collected as texts and images -- might be applied, or how they might be useful to Dancehouse. In this respect, I'd also like to learn from you and your team about your audiences and plans, and to help me see this work through their eyes. 

Some questions that I think might be useful at this stage in our conversation are (although please feel free to ignore ones that make you groan):

- How would you describe Dancehouse? What kind of organisation is it?
- Who are its 'publics' (including the artists that work there)? How specific might we be about who to 'engage' through this partnership? 
- What are the regular ways you engage these people? 
- Are there ways of engaging these 'publics' that you haven't tried that you might be interested to try? 
- Which ways of engaging feel strongest/weakest? 
- Are there particular 'publics' that you'd like to reach that you haven't either tried to or been able to? Might this collection of memories be a way of reaching those people? 
- The engagement activities could simply be an 'exhibition' (as I've discussed it up to now), or conversations, writing, workshops, social media (e.g. gathering images/memories on instagram), research we might do together, web-based things, lecture, co-curation, or some un-holy combination of these things!

At some point we'll likely need to think about how to understand the 'success' of this 'engagement process'. I find this difficult, but I do wonder how best to evaluate the value of the work to your community and organisation (and to my research project). I tend to be less interested in numbers ("not everything that counts can be counted") and more curious about the quality of experiences, but I imagine you have some pretty strong feelings about this. Perhaps though this partnership might be an opportunity to consider how evaluating the work might also be part of the engagement, or that we can think creatively about how best to get a sense of whether the work mattered to people, and how. 

Thanks so much Josh. I hope this is a little more helpful than my last effort. 

Simon

## plain-language email re unforgettable


Dear 

It occurs to me that my last email likely blind-sided you with a whole heap of 'stuff'. I want to apologise for this.

Here goes ... 

We can agree that dancers have some kind of knowledge of what they are doing; that they _know how_ to do what they are doing. But it's not easy to explain or understand what it means to know something through or in dance. We might use a word like 'embodied' to describe the way a dancer-in-their-body seems to know something, but this isn't necessarily very helpful. For example, how would we recognise a disembodied dancer? _Finger Pointing Moon_ is a dance research project about what it means to know through and in our moving bodies. 

I am proposing to you a part of this project which I've called _Unforgettable_. It gets at the problem of knowing in dance by asking people all around the world what their strongest memory of dance is -- either doing or watching it. In this way it connects our memory of dancing with our knowledge of dancing. I will collect these recollections, organise them a little bit, and then give them to you at The Work Room to work with in some way. This might be about a series of workshops with them, an installation, a web-page, or something else -- whatever you think best serves your community's needs and interests. I am happy to be as involved (or uninvolved) as you would prefer, but I do wonder to what extent we might work together to make decisions through some kind of collaborative engagement.

What I'm hoping to achieve with _Unforgettable_ is to inspire and inform people about the way our memories are a vital part of how we come to know dancing and the moving body. I am interested to find out how this idea -- and the materials collected as memories -- might be applied, or how they might be useful to The Work Room. In this respect, I'd also like to learn from you and your team about your audiences and plans, and to help me see this work through their eyes. 

Some questions that I think might be useful at this stage in our conversation are (although please feel free to ignore ones that make you groan):

Thanks so much Anita. I hope this is a little more helpful than my last effort.
