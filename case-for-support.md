# Case for Support - Finger Pointing Moon

## The Research Problem and Questions

>You should describe clearly the research questions, issues or problems that you intend to address. What are the issues that you will be exploring in the course of your research?

_Finger Pointing Moon_ aims to address practice-research's fundamental, long-standing and most controversial epistemic question: **What can we know or understand differently as a consequence of practice-research?**[^sh] 

this is because it hasn't yet happened. built on assumptions and proxies.
it's important because currently we generate undefendable outcomes in which anyone can say anything. but what do we get or gain from something different? 

add something in this first paragraph of why it matters?  Why is it important?


All research processes in all disciplines adopt the most suitable methods to recognise change or difference in the materials or data of those processes. When artist-scholars adopt practice-research methods it is therefore _implied_ but rarely stated that these methods are best able to reveal change and difference in the artistic materials and experiences that underpin the research. Yet what types of changes or differences are _really_ made possible by practice-research and how might we recognise them?  

Practice-research is variously known as practice-research, practice-led research, artistic research, practice-based research and practice-as-research. It is not a singular method but rather a broad approach to integrating creative practice into scholarly contexts. The underpinning practices are diverse, distinct and often singular or one-off entities. Broadly speaking, the approach is characterised by the following: it is first-person, and involves self-critical reflection and analysis; it has a prolonged engagement with repetition through artistic practice; it often has an unstable or complex relationship to language and dissemination; and it deals with experiences that are commonly ambiguous and hidden. Given these characteristics -- and the historically tenuous footing of practice-research inside the Academy -- it is not surprising that the diverse range of outcomes artist-scholars state as research _findings_ are often at best conceived _a priori_, or at worst simply made up. _Finger Pointing Moon_ is predicated on the possibility that there is a systemic failure in practice-research to directly address the changes and differences made possible through research-focused artistic practices. 

**change this last sentence to make it a question (something to 'prove')**.

In this research I propose to use body-based practice-research as a lens through which to critically examine the diverse collection of methods that comprise practice-research. By _body-based_ I mean the artistic-scholarly practices of dance and somatics where the body underpins both the practices and the development of new understandings. These practices are predicated on movement, gesture, posture and stillness. I propose to use body-based practice as a research lens because they represent an edge-case of the epistemic limits and possibilities of practice-research: they have a complex and often fraught relationship with language; the experiential nuances are not seen, but _felt_; they intersect with contested issues of embodiment and tacit awareness; and they have an equally contested relationship to disappearance, ephemerality and documentation. **Somewhere you need to talk about the importance of these things** In _Finger pointing moon_ body-based practice-research will function as a case-study through which to examine and understand three underpinning epistemic problems **Why are these problems?** in practice-research to do with 'new knowledge' or 'new understandings': 1) The problem of the proxy; 2) The problem of what can and cannot be known; 3) The problem of specificity. These three problems act as a conceptual structure for the research design and sit under the overarching project aim to address practice-research's fundamental epistemic question: _What can we know or understand differently as a consequence of practice-research?_ **I think this is really important and needs to be brought to the fore.  It speaks to the importance of the research.**

### Three underpinning epistemic problems in practice-research

#### 1. The Problem of the Proxy

>they see that language is only a finger pointing at the moon and not the moon itself.[@johnston_cloud_2012 p.2]

The complexities -- and sometimes impossibilities -- of articulating what is understood differently through practice-research may have created another distinct problem. Whereas in the early stages of the development of practice-research there was considerable focus on its epistemic underpinnings,[^under] since 2011 this scholarship has all but disappeared. At the same time there has been a sharp rise in scholarship using the ill-defined term _embodied knowledge_ (and its cousin _tacit knowledge_) as a concept to describe the epistemic value of (body-based) practice-research.[^ek1] Could it be that these two phenomena are related: that in the place of scholarship directly exploring the epistemics of practice-research, artist-scholars have replaced it with a proxy? That artist-scholars who research through movement practices are failing to address the profound experiential changes and differences generated through practice, while valorising and reifying the concept of embodied knowledge; as if to say, the body knows and _ipso facto_ practice-research generates knowledge. An epistemic proxy does not address the epistemic complexity of practice-research, but rather what can be understood differently through practice-research is kept at arm's length. After all, "proxies are easier to manipulate than the complicated reality they represent".[@oneil_weapons_2016 Chapter 3] In _Finger Pointing Moon_ I seek to understand the extent to which the proxy of embodied knowledge is blinding artist-scholars to the _reality_ of the underlying limits and possibilities of body-based practice-research. Without epistemic clarity, practice-research's value as an approach to understanding the ambiguous, messy and complex experiences of human artistic endeavour are diminished. **You hint at value here. I think you need something upfront on value/impact/importance etc.**

[^ek1]: e.g Midgelow [-@midgelow_introduction_2019]; 

#### 2 The Problem of What Can and Cannot Be Known

Practice-research has a long and important history with ambiguity. The _ways of knowing_ as represented by artistic artefacts inevitably involve messy and productive uncertainty; that when we are doing practice-research we are lost in the "mangle of practice".[@pickering_mangle_1995] This is the suggestion -- sometimes implicit, other times explicit -- that the epistemic essence of practice-research has only the _potential_ for meaning as a feature, and not a bug.[@ellis_that_2018] In other words, that the epistemic work of artistic-research artefacts is to set in motion the possibility of understanding, the possibility of apprehension, the possibility of knowing differently. There are strong and important reasons for valuing research that pedals ambiguity. At the same time, there has been little if any concerted effort to recognise and/or articulate the epistemic limitations of practice-research: what are the things, experiences and sensations that cannot be known, understood or articulated? Between these two situations -- the ambiguity and messiness of what _might_ be known differently and what is not able to be known differently through practice-research lies the second problem underpinning _Finger Pointing Moon_. This second problem is the key epistemic paradox of creative practice-research: that its nature lies at least in part in what is _not_ able to be known, understood or articulated as a consequence of creative practices.[^ttp1] This is a humbling limitation for any research method or process. But it is also a limitation that is vital to examine and articulate in order to prevent _anything being possible or conceived of as 'knowledge'_ in practice-research. In other words, in order to understand what can be known and articulated through practice-research, we must attempt to understand what cannot. 

#### 3. The Problem of Specificity

Generalisability is a key aspect of positivist research methods. That if we know _this thing or state_ about one (smaller) population or sample we can generalise that same thing or state to another (larger) population. Generalisability provides limited but vital powers of prediction. The flip side of generalisability is specificity. For example, in medical research specificity is generated by the power of case-studies. That if a single case of a medical condition exists then it not able to tell us anything about a population, but it does tell us that this problem exists and that it is _very_ likely that it will exist in other people. 

Practice-research projects are, by and large, a series of hyper-specific case-studies. Each practice-research project is a single case-study that is able to say only certain things about the experiences, practices and understandings in that specific project. At its best such specificity affords clarity, nuance, and profound understanding. At its worst it creates insularity: an extraordinary series of research bubbles that rarely touch each other, rarely talk to each other, and rarely even know of each other's existence. Research, by definition, involves critical and open dialogue with other similar or overlapping practices. The problem of specificity in practice-research is that its various ideas, methodological practices and understandings (or 'findings') are rarely if ever in open and critical dialogue with each other.  

### Objectives

The aim of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is to address practice-research's fundamental epistemic question: _What can we know or understand differently as a consequence of practice-research?_ I focus on this wide-angle question by creating objectives that address what I've described as the three underpinning problems of practice-research. A schematic of the research design -- and the inter-relationships between aim, problems, objectives, methods and outcomes -- is presented on page XX. 

_1. The problem of the proxy:_

1. identify key uses and characteristics of 'embodied knowledge' in artistic-scholarly literature, focusing on dance and somatics practice-research
2. identify and critique any epistemic ambiguities/limitations/possibilities in this scholarship
3. if required propose precise, clear alternatives that speak directly to the epistemic limits and possibilities of body-based practice-research 

_2. The Problem of What Can and Cannot Be Known:_

4. identify qualities of experience in body-based practice that resist being known, are deeply uncertain, or are unable to be articulated
5. identify qualities of experience in body-based practice that assist being known, display some quality of certainty, or are able to be articulated  

_3. The Problem of Specificity:_

6. examine language of epistemic outcomes (or 'findings, failures and indescribables') in body-based practice-research
7. collate and share this 'language of findings' 
8. systematically develop alternative linguistic possibilities for describing ways of knowing ('language of findings') in practice-research 
9. generate set of epistemic principles underpinning practice-research
10. generate set of epistemic values in practice-research that transparently and rigorous detail examples of "who, when [and] why is creating knowledge."[@mignolo_epistemic_2009 p.160]

- need to clarify where these principles and values things came from. At the moment they just jump in (but are clearly related to specificity/generalisability)

## Research context 

>You should describe the research context for your project/programme of work. Why is it important that these questions or issues are explored? What other research is being or has been conducted in this area? What contribution will your project make to improving, enhancing, or developing creativity, insights, knowledge or understanding in your chosen area of study? To whom will the outcomes of your research be of particular interest?

## Research design and methods 

>What research methods will you be using to address the questions or issues that you have set yourself, or solve the problems you have identified, or to explore the matters you intend to investigate? Why have you chosen these methods? Why are they the best way to answer the research questions or problems you have identified? What will be your role? If there are other people involved, what will their roles be and why are they the appropriate people to be involved? 

>In describing your research methods it is not sufficient to state, for example, that you intend to visit a particular archive, or an exhibition abroad. You must provide adequate details of sources to be consulted, and you should state briefly what kinds of material you will be consulting, why they are relevant to your programme of research, and how you will interrogate them. Depending on the approach you are using throughout your research, you may also need to explain clearly the creative and/or performative aspects of the work, explain how you will develop a new process, product or tool, or provide details of who you have consulted or will be involved in the process of research.

>Under the Research Methods heading you should also outline how any copyright or intellectual property issues relating to the project and the production of any outputs will be addressed.

>convince decision makers that ‘this is the best solution’ and feel compelled to fund it – (approx >50% of content); 

### Research design

Figure 1: Schematic of project research design to make transparent how the research aim, problems, objectives, methods and outcomes inter-relate. 


>"Epistemic things are the unknown, or vaguely known, objects of investigation that are the counterparts of experimental conditions (the technical objects). They do not simply yield in docile fashion to the technologies of investigation" (Mody and Lynch 2010, 3; see also Rheinberger 1997, 30-31). [@gramelsberger_laboratory_2013 p.104]

- what might the technologies of investigation be in par? 
- what do I imagine the objects of investigation to be in this work?

### Research methods

The research methods are designed to create the conditions in which to directly respond to and _achieve_ the project objectives. These objectives, in turn, feed directly into the three research problems. The research problems -- _proxy_, _can and cannot be known_, and _specificity_ -- are 'meta' or wide-angle problems in practice-research. The following methods are appropriate to the breadth of these problems, while affording detail where necessary. The methods are multi-modal, and comprise practice-research fieldwork and scholarly research to understand experiences and understandings of practice-research epistemics from the inside (through experimental practice) and the outside (through traditional scholarship). They are detailed below, and are organised under the three overarching problems they directly address.   

**Problem 1 'proxy':**

- Comprehensive literature review of body-based practice-research scholarship that emphasises embodied and tacit knowledge
- Critical and theoretical analysis of the language used in these scholarly (and practice-oriented) materials to identify any epistemic patterns, ambiguities and oversights
- Creative and analytical 'reconfiguration' (where necessary or appropriate) of these linguistic patterns that reveal the presence or absence of the epistemic proxy

**Problem 2 'can and cannot be known':**  

+ traditional scholarship: literature and field (practice) review of published materials that implicitly and/or explicitly examine epistemics of body-based practice (some overlap of materials examined in Problem 1)  
+ practice-research: process-driven experimental movement practice as paradigmatically complex and experientially driven 
    * paradigmatic cases of the problem of knowledge production in practice-research generally, and in dance specifically | Use of body-based practice as a edge-case example -- to go into heart of problem that makes broader/wider principles possible.
    * Dance and choreographic practices are paradigmatic in this method, because "The body is both a question and an inaccessible answer ... [where] the unseen shimmers, the unheard whispers, the unfelt is caressed and we intuit the unknown."[@heathfield_what_2011] 
+ practice-research: collecting practice of 'unforgettable experiences of body-based practice/performance'
    * collecting hand-written notes/letters of others about memories of watching dance/performance. Key: analogue, experience of watching (vs 'doing' in experimental movement practice above) 
    * watching and/or doing (not sure whether to focus on watching only)
    * cataloguing of collected letters/responses (sorting into various kinds of works, responses, years, etc)
+ practice-research: collecting practice of epistemic materials, traces, ideas, notes, thoughts focusing on 'The Un/knowable Body'

**Problem 3 'specificity':**  
+ traditional scholarship: collect representative sample of body-based practice-research outcomes (exploring range from those that describe explicit findings to those in which the practice-outputs are presented to 'speak for themselves') -- could use sample from REF2021 in UK?
+ traditional scholarship: critical analysis of this sample to understand the language artist-scholars use to describe their understandings or 'findings'. 

## Project plan and timetable 

>you are expected to be confident and specific about what you will do, who will do it, when you will do it, and how long it will take – in a realistic approximation


## Leadership development plan 

>This section of the Case for Support should include details of your proposed leadership activities, and an explanation of why these activities are appropriate to exercising research leadership in your field. You should make clear how these activities enhance the transformational potential of the research and its broader influence and importance. Please refer to Research and leadership activities for further details on what is requirement for this section.

>First let’s establish that the concept of “individualization” should not be confused with the neoliberal ideology of “individualism” that shifts all responsibility for success or failure to a mythical, atomized, isolated individual, doomed to a life of perpetual competition and disconnected from relationships, community, and society. Neither does it refer to the psychological process of “individuation” that is associated with the lifelong exploration of self-development. Instead, individualization is a consequence of long-term processes of modernization.[@zuboff_age_2019 Chapter 2.2]

- thinking about individuation (relating to solitude) v individualism (opposite of Bendell)

solitude and collective
use a practice -- it's how I come to understand things
+ practice-research: solitude practice (speculative _wildcard_)

solitude practice: (leadership focused) One hour daily in solitude and silence - "doubts, or questions, or even just difficulties ... can only be found within--without distractions, without peer pressure, in solitude".[^deres2010] This component is speculative and unknown. It's a wildcard. 

But _Finger Pointing Moon_ is also a project in which the possibilities and limitations of leadership are built into the research design. It is a project _about_ leadership -- "a word to describe significant _actions_ enabling _change_ that is welcomed by affected _people_."[@bendell_leadership_2019] The concept and potential status of leadership is not a funding-led _container_ to bolster my claims to be a practice-research disciplinary leader. Rather, the overarching design is built around leadership that involves _actions_, _change_ and _people_. 

- add something here (or in paragraph after) about these three things (actions, change, people) - something about Bendell's thinking is about responding to the climate crisis. 

>we can be clearer about the kinds of actions that are useful to describe as “leadership” rather than something else, like “management” or “organising”. Leadership actions are those that help shift the way groups, networks or whole communities of people relate and so such actions generate effects over time. [@bendell_leadership_2019]

To generate a flexible set of epistemic principles able to be used across disciplines and practices is a bold aim. It is also an aim that is founded on two seemingly paradoxical values that underpin the nature of leadership: authority and humility. In other words, _who_ has the authority to know, and _how_ might humility act to attenuate such authority? In _Finger Pointing Moon_ I will scrutinise the nature of authority in leadership by working with the radically analogue nature of the human body to examine _who_ gets to know, and _how_ they get to know. The project will be built on first-person research methods to deepen our understanding of two broad areas: creative practice-research, and leadership.

2. To interrogate leadership as a practice of humility, and examine how practices of humility, patience and listening play a role in construction of knowledge. 

- to understand leadership as a practice of humility  
- to build leadership as humility into understanding _who, when and why_ is constructing knowledge 
- focus on collective organising; strategies for collective organising: collecting practice? (this is the bit about 'people' from Bendell)
- leadership/practice connected by corporeal actions: what the body can do, and what the body does (fare: to make and to do)
- examine through practice the role of solitude in understanding leadership, action and change (contrast this with 'group epistemics' from That Thing Produced – actually, not in contrast. I think they sit together quite clearly. (see [@sennett_together_2012 p.21] -- about getting outside yourself)

## Project management 

>How will the project be managed? What will be the roles of the members of staff involved (including you and, if applicable, any Co-Investigator(s), any research assistants)? What is the timetable for the project? Does it include appropriate milestones and is it realistic? When will the outputs of the project be completed? How will you ensure that they meet the needs of your audience? Can the 
costs be justified? How will you ensure good value for money? 
The project management section should also include the management of the digital and data management aspects of the projects, if applicable, and should be coordinated with the information in the Data Management Plan. It should be clear what the milestones for the completion of this element and the work should be incorporated into the timetable for the whole project. The project management of the data management aspects of the project should include an assessment of risk in relation to the complexity and delivery of the project.
If a postdoctoral researcher is to be employed, you should state clearly the nature of the work they will be undertaking and describe clearly the working relationships that are envisaged between all the 
members of the research team. You should describe fully the arrangements for supervising and managing the research assistant. If the researcher is unknown you should state the skills and qualifications sought. Similarly, if the project involves a visit to or a secondment from a member of staff from another organisation, you must state clearly what work they will pursue and describe the 
working relationships envisaged with other members of the team.
In terms of supporting the research staff funded on the project, you should clearly outline the development opportunities which the project will make available. These should include opportunities both in relation to research expertise, and wider opportunities, for example, in connection with the activities proposed in the Pathways to Impact statement.

develop an original set of practice-research epistemic principles (and also set of values).

- the power of specificity (case-studies in medicine)
- danger in research ideas, practices and projects that are not in dialogue with each other
- what do I mean by 'epistemic values'? e.g. transparency and rigour of who, when and why is creating knowledge

We -- artistic-researchers -- have inadvertently created an enormous array of garishly coloured boats filled with important bits and pieces, each of which is bobbing up and down blissfully unaware of the other shiny boats that are so so close.

and a crucial problem in the development of practice-research in the Academy.

- problem of what can't be known: problem of unknown (and certainly unarticulated) epistemic limitations of practice-research --  
key epistemic paradox of 

This line of inquiry has fallen away or disappeared and it is not clear why. In more embodied creative practices (like dance, performance, live-art), the concept of _embodied knowledge_ has emerged as a form of epistemic proxy or red herring, 

. But even if it is correct to suggest that the 'body knows' (whatever this might mean), such a statement sheds little if any light on understanding the effects of working with and through practice-research. Therefore, the epistemic limits and possibilities of practice-research remain profoundly unclear. 

There is an epistemic crisis in body-based practice-research.  In much of that research, the idea that the body _knows_ acts as a proxy for the epistemic limitations of practice-research investigations. In other words, 

Need to ask this as a question. That is -- not something I already think/believe. Recognise that embody is a term used loosely (can draw on definitions here), but analysis of how it is used, and potentially what is not being said. This is a kind of 'meta' or high-level approach.

Why is hunch important? Because the proxy blinds us to the limits and possibilities of practice-research epistemics

>Have we somehow conspired to arrange matters so that knowledge is always what we say about something rather than what we show about it? [@biggs_editorial_2002]

By addressing these problems I aim to produce epistemic values and principles for body-based practice-research (but might be able to be extended beyond )

The contemporary cultural backdrop for the tension between embodied knowledge, the unknowable, and the inarticulable is the datafication of human experience. In 2017 _The Economist_ declared that the "world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data".[^econ] We live in the age of _surveillance capitalism_ that is founded on "extractive operations in which our personal experiences are scraped and packaged as the means to others’ ends".[^zub1] The cultural and financial capital of understanding the world-as-data means it is not surprising that precarious and delicate artistic practices and processes located in and through the body – like dance and somatics – have also become enamoured by the doctrine of datafication. The rapidly growing number of online archives, digital forms of documentation, and virtual and augmented reality projects are all implicit or explicit attempts by dance scholars to transform the radically analogue nature of embodied experiences into data.[^plethora] 

is underpinned by these two phenomena: the limitations of embodied practice-research, and the datafication of experience. These phenomena are related because the construction and production of knowledge in any scholarly field is never based on the simple and objective observation of worldly phenomena. Rather, to understand what we say we know and do not know, the vital epistemic question is in fact "who, when, [and] why is constructing knowledges?"[^mig1] If the overwhelming contemporary phenomenon is the extraction of data from human experiences, then the question of _who, when and why is constructing knowledges_ necessitates an encounter with the limits and excesses of datafication. 

In this project, I propose that complex and radically analogue human experiences like experimental choreographic and movement practices have ontologies that are underpinned by two key characteristics: a) they defy the capacity to be accurately and wholly articulated and shared; and b) they exceed "algorithmic description".[@odell_how_2019] _Finger Pointing Moon_ is positioned squarely at the intersection of the datafication of human experience and the limitations of embodied practice-research. 

_Finger Pointing Moon_ is a project designed around creative practices that resist datafication, understanding and articulation, and the overarching purpose of the design is to create the conditions in which to develop an original set of practice-research epistemic principles (and also set of values). How does this aim relate to datafication? More like it's something to push against -- that it acts as a 'measure' of utility and function. That if something resists that process, it reveals things about the nature of that _something_. This makes the concept of datafication a methodological (and conceptual/theoretical?) strategy. A kind of thought experiment.
