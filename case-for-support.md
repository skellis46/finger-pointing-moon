# Finger pointing moon: recognising change through practice-research 

## The Research Problem and Questions

Practice-research is the de-facto means by which artist-scholars make claims for new knowledge in the Academy. However, "no epistemology of artistic research has yet been produced."[^schiesser] _Finger Pointing Moon_ uses three research questions to tackle the problem of what is known differently when using practice-research methods:

[^schiesser]: Schiesser (2015) _What Is at Stake: qu’est-ce que l’enjeu?_, p.201.

_RQ1 Limits:_ What are the epistemic limits of artistic practice-research? What aspects of practices are not able to be known or articulated? 

_RQ2 Proxies_: What are practice-research's common epistemic proxies and what is their effect on the significance of practice-research as an approach for developing new insights? 

_RQ3 Hyper-specificity_: How can the language used by artist-scholars to express approaches and findings be adapted to develop increased dialogue across their research findings and outputs?

_Finger Pointing Moon_ uses practice-research and allied methods to examine the line between what is able to be known and what is not. _Finger Pointing Moon_'s research focus on the epistemic limits of practice-research serves the project's overarching aim to deepen understanding of the epistemic limits of the human body. The diverse outputs proposed in the research and development components of the fellowship also reveal how epistemic concerns and "epistemic well-being"[^boyd] are vital to the wider public.

## Research context 

### Why is it important that the research questions are explored?

_Finger Pointing Moon_ adopts empirical practice-research fieldwork as a starting point to test practice-research's epistemic possibilities, limitations and failings. The RQs are designed to examine the problem of knowledge in practice-research by exploring how: i) variations of process are circulated and fetishized;[^nelson] ii) representational proxies are assumed to stand in for "epistemic things";[^conflict] iii) outcomes are rarely explicitly made in dialogue with other overlapping practices;[^biggs2011] and iv) there are few if any limits to the epistemic claims made on behalf of practice-research.[^biggs2011]

[^biggs2011]: Biggs & Büchler (2011) _Communities, Values, Conventions and Actions_.

### Other research in this area

Past work to describe an epistemology of practice-research has been theoretical. The concepts of practical knowledge (_technê_) and know-how have been evoked to understand artistic-research specific epistemics.[^debate2006] This work has failed to distinguish know-how in practice-research from know-how in any research discipline,[^johnson2011] and has not made it clear if practice-research knowledge is in the artistic artefact and/or with the researcher. 

[^debate2006]: Borgdorff (2006) _The Debate on Research in the Arts_.
[^johnson2011]: Johnson, Biggs & Karlsson (2011) _Embodied Knowing Through Art_.

Key theoreticians Scrivener and Borgdorff have separately focused on the limits of the artefact in practice-research and drawn the art object's audience into the issue -- Borgdorff through hermeneutics, and Scrivener by arguing that artefacts require interpretation.[^scrivener2002]  

[^scrivener2002]: Scrivener (2002) _The art object does not embody a form of knowledge_.

Other work has built on Scrivener's idea that the audience is central to the epistemic project of practice-research. Rather than producing knowledge itself, the artist produces "a compelling, mesmerising question"[^magee] and the artefact affords understanding in the audience.[^ellis2018] 

[^magee]: Magee (2012) _Introduction. Part 1: Beyond accountability?_, p.5.
[^ellis2018]: Ellis (2018) _That thing produced_.

### My contribution to improving, enhancing, or developing creativity, insights, knowledge or understanding in the area

The research design of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is based on two propositions: i) that practice-research is not adequately tuned to recognise change resulting from research-focused artistic practices; ii) body-based practices provide an ideal methodological lens through which to investigate the epistemic complexity of practice-research.

_Body-based_ practices like choreography and somatics are unique because they have a particularly complex and often fraught relationship with language;[^bauer] the experiential nuances are not seen but felt;[^ellis2020] the practices intersect with contested issues of embodiment and tacit awareness;[^kampe] and they further complicate problems to do with disappearance, ephemerality and documentation.[^ellis2005] 

[^bauer]: Bauer & Söderhult (2019) _No Time for Judgement / More Time for Judgement_.
[^ellis2020]: Ellis (2020) _Corporeal Epistemics_.
[^kampe]: Kampe (2019) _Body-Soma-Self Re-embodying Dance Research_.
[^ellis2005]: Ellis (2005) _Indelible: A Hypermedia Remembering_.

In _Finger Pointing Moon_ I will move from deep inside body-based practice towards disciplinary-level theory. The theory will draw practice-research out from behind technê and epistemic proxies to understand the limits and margins of practice-research epistemic things. I will also examine the set of epistemic beliefs that implicitly sustain practice-research. This will mean proposing language for an evidence-based epistemic approach to practice-research while accepting that there are things in practice-research that resist understanding and transmission.

### Who will be most interested in the outcomes? 

The research outcomes will be most interesting to arts and humanities scholars working with practice-research. The work will also be valuable to epistemologists who are researching epistemic edge-cases. The practice aspects of the research will help body-based research specialists grapple with the epistemic potential of their work, and particularly in relation to contested ideas of embodied and tacit knowledge. The developmental components of the project (see Development Plan) are designed to enhance the scope, reach and impact of the research for non-academic beneficiaries. 

## Research methods 

### Which research methods?

The research methods are: **practice-research fieldwork**, 2 x 3-week blocks (20 hours per week) of Authentic Movement; **experimental documentation** developed with writing and still and moving images; **empirical and sensorial observation** through first and third-person observation of the practice; **systematic literature and field review and meta-analysis** of practice-research to identify epistemic patterns, ambiguities and proxies, and to understand languages used to express approaches, findings and failures; **critical analysis** of materials to develop understanding of epistemic proxies in practice-research, and to design and share a lexicon of epistemic findings and failures in practice-research; and **scholarly writings** to understand and communicate findings.

### Why these methods?

The methods address the research questions from the inside through _experimental practice-research_, and the outside through _traditional scholarship_: 

#### Experimental practice-research

The methodological heart of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is an experimental form of Authentic Movement (AM) deployed as practice-research fieldwork.

AM is a process-oriented movement practice that distinguishes the body as observed from the outside and the soma as perceived from the inside. It provides a structured body-based process of empirical (visible) and sensorial (non-visible) observation. The slipperiness of contemplative practice like AM, often beyond the reach of language and complicated to document, is essential to the project. In _Finger Pointing Moon_ AM is a prototypical methodological system through which to observe the epistemic limits and possibilities of body-based work, and to propose extrapolations of these limits to other practice-research disciplines. 

The practice will involve three people. Ellis and Whalley will work with AM and will change between the roles of mover and observer. While working they will adapt the practice (including using first, second and third-person photography and videography) and experiment with the limits and possibilities of observable and sensorial experience. Kneebone will act as an external observer to the practice. The three roles afford degrees of proximity to the empirical and non-empirical qualities of the practice-research, and provide the means by which to excavate what lies in-between and behind the artistic practice.

The practice will be documented from within via photography, videography, written and spoken reflections, and from the outside by the third collaborator's observations and analysis.  

In _Finger Pointing Moon_ the artistic practice will be a research outcome [1] and then applied as a research object to underpin the other research methods, outputs and outcomes.  

#### Traditional scholarship

The experimental practice-research fieldwork will be supplemented by traditional _desk-based_ scholarly methods as listed above in _Which research methods_. These methods will make it possible to extrapolate the field-based data (the focus of RQ1) to cross-disciplinary outputs and outcomes that explore the epistemic failures and possibilities of practice-research (RQ2 and RQ3). That is, the traditional scholarly methods will contextualise and broaden the value of the artistic fieldwork.

The experimental and traditional research methods address 
the focus of the research component of _Finger Pointing Moon_: to understand the epistemic limits of practice-research. I build on these research methods through various curatorial and public engagement processes in the development component of the project (See Development Plan). The research and development components together address the project's overarching aim to deepen understanding of the epistemic limits of the human body. 

### Copyright or intellectual property issues

The IP for project outputs will belong to PI Ellis at CovUni. The IP for **O1** and **O2** will be shared with Whalley and Kneebone. The IP for the curated talks [O10] will belong to the presenters. There are no unusual copyright or IP issues except for the two curated exhibitions [O3,O4]. The exhibition materials will be attributed with permission from original authors and/or Creative Commons licensed. The Discourse forum [O9] will be a public online space that requires users to sign-up. It will be moderated by a group of volunteers to ensure no copyright laws are broken.

## Development plan 

I have been an artist for 30 years, and an artist in the academy for 20 years. I have developed individual research practices that have led to small-scale outcomes, and have mostly resisted direct public dissemination and engagement strategies. The project's development plan filters understanding developed through the research component and applies it to circumstances in which artists and the wider public are influenced by epistemic concerns. The plan will enhance my role within practice-research and develop the importance of my research to communities of interest by helping me acquire four new capabilities: 1) communicate niche ideas about epistemics of practice-research beyond the practice-research field to the wider public; 2) demonstrate leadership in methodological advances in practice-research; 3) develop and support a broad cross-disciplinary community of active artist-scholars; and 4) create collaborative opportunities with academic and non-academic stake-holders. 

These four capabilities will be developed through four bold activities/outputs:

_1. Unforgettable_ [O3] will be an exhibition of materials from a practice of gathering the public's experiences of dance and movement. Artists, scholars and audiences from around the world will be networked to send writing that describes a single unforgettable experience of dance or dancing. These documents will be developed into bespoke exhibitions by working with artists and audiences associated with project partners in England and Scotland. _Unforgettable_ builds on the research's epistemic narrative by exploring the role of memory in understanding how we come to know what we know. The process and exhibition are designed to: i) inspire creativity in how other researchers understand and represent the scope of their largely theoretical undertakings; ii) seek wider impact by ambitiously engaging a broad cross-section of participants; iii) develop new and formal research-informed partnerships and collaborations with non-academic organisations in the UK, and informal collaborations with people who submit materials from around the world.

_2. The Un/knowable Body_ [O4] will involve collecting a large quantity of cross- and inter-disciplinary audio-visual-text materials that reveal the limits, margins and possibilities of human understanding of the body. The materials will be gathered by the PI and RA and then sent to project partners in Australia and Italy. Both partners will work with their local communities -- in consultation with the PI -- to explore ways to organise the materials and then develop a bespoke programme of events that explore knowledges of the body. _The Un/knowable Body_ explores a key part of the research component of _Finger Pointing Moon_ by addressing what can be known -- and what remains unknown -- about visual and sensorial experiences of the human body. The activity will: i) foster interdisciplinary research by working with and presenting materials from across disciplinary boundaries; ii) inspire creativity in other researchers by creating models for public engagement that emerge from those publics (rather than top-down or researcher focused models); iii) create wider impact for the research aspects of the project by building relationships between theoretical (and niche) ideas to do with epistemology with accessible and meaningful materials for the wider public; iv) create new research partnerships and collaborations between the PI and project partners.

_3. Artistic Research forum_ [O9] will create and support a broad cross-disciplinary community of scholars and artists working with practice-research. It will be an online Discourse Forum[^disc] that will modernise old-style email-based list-servs like PARIP, and act as a large-scale _conversation_ on historical, current and future thinking, practices and understandings of practice-research. The forum will be sustained by the discourse community itself with moderation from a group of experienced and emerging artist-scholars volunteering from around the world; it will, in effect, be a collaboration across the entire practice-research community, and open to all. This is an ambitious activity that will: i) enable the PI to provide intellectual leadership through an openly accessible network of artist-scholars; ii) inspire creativity and development in other researchers both through materials posted to the forum and through its open and collaborative form; iii) help shape research agendas in which the forum acts like a town-square environment where vital conversations are easily heard and contributed to (e.g. O10 curated talks); iv) encourage new research collaborations as contributors engage with the materials and ideas presented in the forum; v) strengthen quality of individual research projects by exposing them to debate and dialogue through the forum.

_4. The Point Beyond_ [O8] is a podcast that will explore the limits of what it is to be human. It will comprise two series of eight episodes, and each episode will be a conversation with an expert that explores the point beyond which our understanding and experience falters. The two series will be _limits of knowledge_ and _limits of language_. _The Point Beyond_ attempts to take the research heart of _Finger Pointing Moon_ -- the limits and possibilities of human understanding -- and extrapolate that work into other areas. It will: i) inspire creativity and development in other researchers by building broad cross-disciplinary and wider-public interest in ideas that matter to how we understand being human; ii) directly foster inter- and cross-disciplinary research involving artistic research by building lively and focused conversations with other experts; iii) challenge the PI's ability to communicate complex ideas to a broad audience; iv) focus on clear public engagement: why do these niche and largely theoretical ideas matter and to whom? 

## Project management 

### People and roles

The project will be managed by Ellis (PI, 0.5FTE for months 1-12, 0.8FTE for months 13-18) working with a Research Associate (0.6FTE, 18 months). The PI is experienced managing academic and artistic teams, large research projects and collaborating with industry partners. He will oversee the research methods, supervise and participate in the practice fieldwork and be responsible for overall management of research outputs. He will manage the collaborative work with the project partners to ensure the outputs are curated to meet the needs of the partners' audiences, and his own capability development goals. The practice fieldwork requires expert input from Joanne 'Bob' Whalley and Roger Kneebone. Whalley is an experienced artist-scholar working at the forefront of experimental documentation and writing practices. She will work with Ellis in the practice fieldwork as an expert practitioner and novice AM practitioner -- an ideal insider-outsider perspective. Kneebone is a renowned professor of surgical education, whose recent work has focused on expert practices across the sciences and arts. Kneebone's role in _Finger Pointing Moon_ will be third-person observation, documentation and analysis of the practice fieldwork. Both will contribute to O1 and O2. 

The RA will support the project through bibliographic research, drafting scholarly outputs, event and output organisation, data and website management and a small volume of administration. The RA will be line managed by the PI. They will use a Kanban system for project delivery supplemented by weekly stand-up meetings to review progress, and to make milestone or delivery adjustments. The PI will balance the RA's ongoing professional development with the project's milestones and outputs. The goal will be to help the RA to develop the skills and experience to pursue their own research agenda after the completion of the project. The RA will have a practice-research PhD, and will be experienced in bibliographic research, writing and editing; they will be an excellent verbal and written communicator and have advanced digital literacy. 

There will be a four-person Advisory Group that will meet remotely with the PI at six-month intervals to provide high-level guidance: Efrosini Protopapa, Sarah Whatley, Charlotte Waelde and Lee Miller. CovUni will allocate additional administrative support to the PI for purchasing, finances and technical support when required.

### Timetable and milestones

See the Workplan attachment (Ellis_SK_Workplan.docx) for monthly breakdown of planned research and development activities. 

### Digital and data management

We will seek the consent of contributors to make outputs available with a CC-BY licence. The project will produce low risk Open Access digital outputs online, and they will be stored on the project's CovUni hosted WordPress website: experimental documentation practices [O1]; audio versions of exhibition materials (for visually impaired audiences) and selected visual materials from exhibitions [O3,O4]; epistemic lexicon [O6], and blog [O11]. Video content produced for the project will be stored securely, uploaded to C-DaRE's Vimeo account, and embedded in the project website: Zoom recordings of curated talks [O10]; media generated during practice-research fieldwork [O1]; and desktop documentary [O7]. The Discourse Forum [O9] software is open-source and will be hosted and managed by CovUni. The podcast [O8] will be hosted off-site at Libsyn, but individual episodes will be embedded in the project website and available freely through Apple Podcasts and Spotify. See Data Management Plan attachment (Ellis_DMP.docx).

## Outputs, Dissemination and Impact

### Beneficiaries and impacts: Who might benefit and how?

Details of _Academic Beneficiaries_ and impacts are presented in Academic Beneficiaries section of the Je-S form. _Non-academic Beneficiaries_ will be as follows:

- **Dance and somatic artists, photographers and movement therapists** will benefit from new experiences of research-informed outcomes that intersect with the professional arts community [O1,O3,O4,O7]. The outcomes will impact these people as sources of inspiration for how they understand, create and share their own work.
- **Professional artists** considering entering the academy will benefit from access to a public forum of experienced artist-scholars and potential peers. Potential impacts include insights into the pros and cons of starting a practice-research higher degree, learning how a research programme might interact with professional artistic practice, and inspiration for developing research ideas [O9,O10]
- The curated exhibitions [O3,O4] will have two types of beneficiaries: i) **artists and members of the public** identified by the PI and project partners to contribute to and participate in the development of the outcomes, and ii) **public audiences** connected to project partners who will witness the exhibitions. Potential impacts will be to inspire users and beneficiaries, to help them develop new skills of reflection, creativity and collaboration, and as sources for learning and enjoyment about the body as a source of understanding and knowledge [O3,O4,O8]
- The podcast [O8] will be promoted to the **wider public**. The goal will be to extend the impact of the research beyond its niche epistemic concerns -- to extrapolate from the body as a site of knowledge in order to inform, inspire and develop new understandings for the public.

Academic and non-academic beneficiaries will be identified at the start through CovUni's research networks, the project team's personal and cross-disciplinary professional networks and in-place social networks (including personal communications, regular social media and currently existing list-servs). The Discourse Forum [O9] will be an emergent space for conversation and sharing between artist and scholars that will grow primarily through word-of-mouth. It will act as a service to the practice-research community but also as a bottom-up method to identify and communicate with project beneficiaries throughout the length of the project (and beyond), and to assess research impacts. 

The PI will work closely with the project partners to identify possible end-users and beneficiaries, and to develop and execute public engagement and evaluation strategies. For example, O3 and O4 are artistic-research processes developed with artists and audiences identified by the partners. The collaborations with project partners are bespoke ways of building relationships over time, engaging their audiences, and evaluating the impact of the outputs. Such bottom-up strategies towards achieving impact -- developed with beneficiaries over extended periods of time -- are fundamental to the project's sense of collaborative discovery. 

### Dissemination, public engagement and exploitation

The project's public profile will be supported by C-DaRE and CovUni communication and marketing, and social media and communication systems belonging to the project partners.  

Many of the outputs have community building and public engagement features built in [O3,O4,O8,O9,O10]. These communities will be brought together both online and through working closely with project partners to develop emergent methods to share, discuss and create conversations about the project outputs and how people are impacted by the research. The ongoing engagement with users and beneficiaries in these outputs will provide wide scope for evaluating the research and assessing the type, quality and importance of research impacts. These evaluations will include basic statistical data (numbers, demographics) and recorded conversations and written reflections. More ephemeral engagements, e.g. with audience members, will be evaluated through follow-up interviews. The goal is to gather rich impact data that reflect the experiences of the users and beneficiaries.

The processes, outcomes and outputs of _Finger Pointing Moon_ will be meticulously documented via the project website to maximise transparency and open accessibility to a wide audience. All original data from the practice-research fieldwork will be openly accessible to other researchers and the wider public. The pre-press versions of articles accepted by journals behind paywalls [O2,O5] will be made available on the project website. All draft and completed text materials from all stages of the project (including the development of this fellowship proposal) will be openly accessible through a GitHub repository.[^git] This OA strategy ensures research transparency and the availability of the ideas, data and outputs for other researchers to transform and publish in accordance with a Creative Commons CC-BY license. The PI has a deliberate practice of using plain language and this practice will underpin the project's communication, public engagement and dissemination strategy.
