# Finger pointing moon: recognising change through practice-research 

(Case for Support for an _AHRC Research, Development and Engagement Fellowship_ proposal)

>... they see that language is only a finger pointing at the moon and not the moon itself.[@johnston_cloud_2012 p.2]

>Some aspects of the world may even be beyond the limits of our thought, so that we cannot form intelligible descriptions of them, let alone know that a particular description is true.[@markie_rationalism_2017 n.p.]

## The Research Problem and Questions

Practice-research has two fundamental epistemic questions: 1) What is known or understood differently as a consequence of practice-research methods? 2) How might these understandings be shared and articulated? The second question has been examined in detail through research into documentation and archives.[^doc] However, the first question has been controversial and under-examined for nearly 30 years. The aim of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is to tackle this first fundamental epistemic question. 

[^doc]: e.g. Heathfield et al. [-@heathfield_shattered_1997]; Lycouris [@lycouris_documentation_2000]; and Performance Research: _On Archives & Archiving_ (2002, v20:6), _On An/Notations_ (2015, v7:4), _On Disappearance_ (2019, v24:7); See also _Journal of Artistic Research_ and _Choreographic Practices_. 

I have developed three epistemic conditions that underpin the project's aim and provide a conceptual structure for the research design **give citations to these where possible**): i) _limits_; in which artist-scholars fail to examine the limits of what can and cannot be known through practice-research; ii) _proxies_; in which genuine research findings are kept at arm's length by concepts, practices or conventions. For example, documentation in practice-research may act as a proxy for empirical evidence;[Kershaw, in @nelson_practice_2013 p.6] and iii) _hyper-specificity_; in which practice-research methods and findings are specific to single projects and rarely form part of critical dialogues in the artistic-scholarly community. 

Perhaps these conditions are axioms?

>In developing these criteria we too are making assumptions about what research is. However, our method is not circular, but axiomatic. Axiomatic argumentation proceeds from a few unverifiable statements that lie outside the system of argumentation, paradigmatically employed by Euclid (2000). One axiom that we have identified in our own approach is that we assume research is a cumulative process.[@biggs_eight_2008 p.8]

>Axioms are discretionary and it is important for the transparency of academic argumentation that the ones that are adopted be identified from the start because, aside from their inef- fability, i.e. they are not explained by the researcher who adopts them and cannot be explained within their system of thought, being discretionary means that it is equally valid to adopt a different axiom.[@biggs_eight_2008 p.8]

_Finger Pointing Moon_ has three research questions based on these conditions:

1. _Limits:_ What are the epistemic limits of practice-research? What aspects of practices are not able to be known, understood or articulated? 

2. _Proxies_: What are practice-research's common epistemic proxies and how do they affect the value of practice-research as an approach for developing new insights? 

3. _Hyper-specificity_: What language is used to express approaches, findings and failures in practice-research? How can this language be adapted in order to create increased critical dialogue between practice-research artist-scholars?

## Research context 

### Why is it important that the research questions are explored?

Practice-research is not a singular method but rather an overarching approach for working with creative practices in scholarly contexts. The approach has four key characteristics: i) it is first-person, and involves self-critical reflection, or _mesearch_;[@rees_self-reflective_2019] ii) it involves repetition through artistic practice;[@blythe_framework_2016] iii) it has a contested relationship to language and dissemination; and iv) it involves experiences that are ambiguous and/or hidden. These characteristics produce "fuzzy"[@borgdorff_conflict_2012 p.181] epistemic possibilities. Consequently, artist-scholars have an open secret: we often conceive our research findings _a priori_ and/or present them _a posteriori_ as reflective spaces[@jeremy_bubb_missing_2020] using vague and hopeful language.[^3examples]

[^3examples]: Here are three arbitrary examples from the Journal of Artistic Research (2020 Vol 20, emphasis added): "_hopefully_ as you continue to read and listen, _it will become gradually clearer_" -- Miller; "the open-endedness of artistic research _allows the possibility_ for the ongoing development of _new insights_ among the wider community of creative practitioners" -- Hunt; and "with this text I’m really _not trying to make any grand statements_. It is a _collection_ of words and decisions that function more as a _demonstration_" -- Norman.

The four characteristics outlined above are uniquely amplified for artist-scholars working with body-based practices. By _body-based_ I mean practices like choreography and somatics predicated on the movements, gestures, postures and stillnesses of bodies, and where those same bodies underpin the development of new understandings. What is unique for body-based practices in relation to the key characteristics of practice-research described above is that: they have a particularly complex and often fraught relationship with language;[@bauer_no_2019] the experiential nuances are not seen, but _felt_;[@ellis_corporeal_2020] the practices intersect with contested issues of embodiment and tacit awareness;[@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011; @kampe_body-soma-self_2019] and they further complicate problems to do with disappearance, ephemerality and documentation.[@ellis_indelible_2005; @ledger_question_2011] 

The conception, context and research design of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is therefore founded on two propositions: i) that there is systemic failure in practice-research to apprehend the changes resulting from research-focused artistic practices; ii) body-based practices provide a clear and provocative methodological lens through which to investigate the epistemic complexity of practice-research.

The three research questions form the spine of the project's focus for practice-research to adopt a more lucid and evidence-based (empirical) relationship with its own epistemic possibilities, limitations and failings. The alternative to not addressing these questions is the status quo in which endless variations of process are circulated and fetishized,[@nelson_practice_2013] representational proxies are assumed to stand in for "epistemic things",[this is a term from @rheinberger_toward_1997; see also @borgdorff_conflict_2012 p.232] outcomes are rarely explicitly made in dialogue with other overlapping practices,[^theory] and there are no limits to unfalsifiable claims to understanding and no limits to the vagueness of these claims. 

[^theory]: Practice-research has a history of referring to theory, not to oppose, confront or build theoretical understandings, but to prop up the academic status of the artistic work. **Citation?** 

If _all_ practice-research is presentable as _truth_ -- even in the sense that "truth is aspirational"[@ingold_search_2018 n.p.] -- then it is broken as an approach to creating new understandings. 

### Other research in this area

In 1992 the UK Higher Education Funding Councils first recognised the work of artists as research and, given the potential "access to highly lucrative government funding",[@magee_introduction._2012 n.p.] art and artists quickly became invested in the production of knowledge. Since then, the epistemological project in practice-research has comprised various attempts to reverse-engineer art-making through an epistemological lens. That is, once art was recognised as research it became necessary to justify and validate its knowledge-producing bona fides, and to avoid a situation in which "the entire history of art [became] eligible for a postgraduate research degree."[@frayling_research_1993 p.5] 

#### The intrinsic-extrinsic debate

The project of creating epistemic justifications for practice-research has been characterised by a continuum bookended by two conflicting positions:[^40k] 1) artistic artefacts require a written statement that synthesises the epistemic status (findings) of the research;[e.g. @noauthor_ref2021_2019; @nelson_practice_2013] 2) artistic artefacts themselves contain and communicate research findings.[e.g. @borgdorff_conflict_2012] 

[^40k]: For example, note the contradiction in the UK that a practice-research PhD normally requires approximately 40k words of contextual writing, while a submission to the Research Excellence Framework only requires a 300 word summary statement. 

Both positions have inherent problems. The extrinsic position -- that knowledge in practice-research is only revealed or clarified through written contextualisation[@bolt_magic_2007; @smith_practice-led_2009; @candy_role_2010] -- limits the importance of the artefact,[@magee_introduction._2012; @borgdorff_debate_2006; @candlin_proper_2000] and sets no margins on the epistemic claims that artistic-scholars make on behalf of their practices. Such claims are rarely "made available for sustained and verifiable peer review".[@haseman_tightrope_2007 n.p.; see also @candy_role_2010] 

The intrinsic position -- that knowledge is intrinsic to or "embodied in"[@borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.vi] artistic-research artefacts[@ellis_that_2018; @borgdorff_conflict_2012] -- positions ambiguity and uncertainty as epistemic virtues that produce "less identifiable knowledge products."[@butt_performance_2014 p.114]. Such products act as points of epistemic resistance: they "resist academic conventions of accountability"[@borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.ix] or "ways of knowing that are not able to shape -- or be shaped by -- the various tools and systems of the knowledge economy."[@ellis_that_2018 p.490]  

The tension between intrinsic and extrinsic _claims to knowledge_ in practice-research looms over all practical and theoretical work in the field.[e.g. @borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.ix] It is a conflict founded on: i) the extent to which scholars and regulatory bodies _believe_ that language is needed to describe and justify claims to knowledge;[e.g. @berry_life_2001; @williams_mindfulness_2012] ii) differing perspectives on the limits of artistic practice outcomes to _hold_ and communicate understanding;[e.g. @stephen_scrivener_art_2002; @borgdorff_debate_2006] and iii) the contested relationship between artistic-scholarly outcomes and the pursuit of truth.[e.g. @nelson_practice_2013; @noe_strange_2015; @ingold_search_2018] 

In _Finger Pointing Moon_ the intrinsic-extrinsic conflict likewise looms over the project's methods, analysis and outcomes. The conflict is the historical epistemic air that the project will breathe. 

**The question becomes then who is changed by it -- and sets up the possibility of [[a case for writing in practice-research]] in which the artist-researcher sometimes does that work of change, other times allows it to rest with the audience/viewer. In this respect it's not so much the presence of writing that confers the status of 'research' on a work of art, but rather that the researcher has done the work of communicating change/understanding (which will not be equivalent to the understandings afforded by the artistic artefact)**

**- reminded here of how useful 'meaning potentials' and 'affordance' is in this case. That something is afforded by practice-research.**

#### Past efforts to describe an epistemology of practice-research

Pakes suggests that it is easy to make the claim for a "distinctive kind of knowledge" emerging from practice-research, but far more difficult to specify the make up of such knowledge.[-@pakes_art_2004 n.p.]

##### Know-how and technê

One early attempt to solve the epistemic problem in practice-research was to invoke the concepts of practical knowledge (_technê_) and know-how as a way of understanding artistic-research specific epistemics.[^techne] This work has three problems: 1) It has rarely made it clear where understanding or knowledge is _located:_ in the work of art or with the researcher. 2) It has failed to distinguish know-how in practice-research from the kind of know-how present in any research discipline. That is, what is peculiar to the concept of know-how in artistic practice-research as compared with, for example, engineering or bioethics? 3) It does not explicitly address _change_ as a consequence of research processes -- in any research process the question of what we understand or know differently as a consequence of that process is fundamental. 

[^techne]: This draws on the work of Aristotle, Ryle, Carr and Polanyi, and more recently Pakes. See Borgdorff for an overview[-@borgdorff_debate_2006]

##### The role of the artefact

Scrivener wrote that the "art object does not embody a form of knowledge."[@stephen_scrivener_art_2002 n.p.] Yet Borgdorff suggests that knowledge is "embodied in art practices (objects, processes)."[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.13] Even in disagreement, both scholars focus on the limits of the artefact in practice-research. In so doing they draw the art object's audience into the issue -- Borgdorff through his focus on hermeneutics, and Scrivener through his argument that artworks (or artefacts) require interpretation, and as such can be called _apprehensions_ or "objects which must be grasped by the senses and the intellect" which when grasped offer "ways of seeing and being".[@stephen_scrivener_art_2002 n.p.]  

##### Audiences

Other work has built on Scrivener's recognition that the audience is fundamental to the epistemic project of practice-research.[e.g. Magee -@magee_introduction._2012; Ellis -@ellis_that_2018] Rather than producing knowledge itself, the artist produces "a compelling, mesmerising question"[@magee_introduction._2012 p.5] and the artefact affords possibilities for understanding in those who experience it. This is a radically "expanded epistemology"[@ellis_that_2018 p.488] in which practice-research is "dependent on its audience to do its epistemic work."[@ellis_that_2018 p.488]  

**Noë writes that in art and philosophy "there aren’t breakthroughs or discoveries or results or findings in these fields, certainly not ones that invalidate or cancel out earlier ones or preclude future ones."[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 11, n.p.] Rather, what we have is more about change, history and evolution; "moves in an important conversation"[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 11, n.p.] that keep that conversation alive and open. Art and philosophy do not produce "stand-alone nuggets of truth"[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 11, n.p.] but are akin to a score which we enact as much as we perceive:**

>We start out not seeing what is there. But by looking and interrogating and challenging, we come to see it. The work challenges us to reorganize our seeing, our expectations, and our thinking. The work of art, like that of philosophy, is the reorganization of ourselves. And this reorganization, this work, aims also at understanding.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 11, n.p.]

**Noë is stating that the value and function of art is not about discovery, but in understanding. We are changed by it.** -- and therefore, the communication of changes becomes vital to the epistemological project in any research, but particularly PaR and in particular (even more) body-based.

Past efforts to describe an epistemology of practice-research reveal the complexity of the problem. There are effectively three _agents_ at play in this intellectual labour -- the artefact, the artist and the audience -- and the extent to which an artist-scholar foregrounds the role of each has determined their position in understanding the epistemic boundaries of practice-research. What is shared between the positions is an overarching relativist constructivist framework. Such a framework gives license to the artist-scholar (and/or the audience) to say anything about the work they present and represent; that is, there are no limits to the claims that are made. 

### My contribution to improving, enhancing, or developing creativity, insights, knowledge or understanding in the area

>Some aspects of the world may be within the limits of our thought but beyond the limits of our knowledge; faced with competing descriptions of them, we cannot know which description is true. Some aspects of the world may even be beyond the limits of our thought, so that we cannot form intelligible descriptions of them, let alone know that a particular description is true.[@markie_rationalism_2017 n.p.]

- empirical: I am not proposing evidence evidence evidence. Tension between evidence, and allowing the creative work to do its work.
- proxy is very different from staring into the belly of not knowing. Accepting the possibility of not knowing or there are things that are not able to be known (use Markie above)
- draw together large range of ideas, opinions and histories that have attempted to handle the epistemology of practice-research
- where the large body of work has used (often by default) a relativist approach to making epistemic claims, my ambition is to incorporate rationalism, and empiricism
- to speak directly to the problems -- push through the fuzziness
- creating language for this empirical approach

- to address the idea that practice-research's place is an epistemic place (and not to stay within realm of techne). to know something differently. to know-that. this is not to reduce or displace know-how or craft. ties to Rheinberger and building epistemic things.
- but what is the nature of this epistemic place? can something that is unknowable (akin to Berry's thinking) except through direct experience (ref from obsidian) be an epistemic thing? And if not, what kind of _thing_ is it? 
- some kind of line between what is observable and standpoint epistemology

interested not only in what we can agree on but what we can clearly disagree about on. what can't be said? some things must be open to debate (other than just methodology). Where is there legitimate disagreement? (heterotopic discourse -- ways of arguing) -- similar to Biggs and Buchler (2010) approach, p.83 of the chapter in their edited volume.

### Who will be most interested in the outcomes? 

The research will be most interesting to artist-scholars from across disciplines who are working in and through practice-research. This includes graduate and postgraduate students who are grappling with how and why their work is important and to whom. The work will also be valuable to philosophers of epistemology who are researching epistemic edge-cases to do with know-how and testimony. Aspects of the research will also be interesting to body-based research specialists who grapple with understanding the epistemic potential of their work, and particularly in relation to contested ideas of embodied and tacit knowledge. 

- add "large range of emerging and established scholars working with practice-research methodologies"

### Research objectives

The aim of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is to address practice-research's fundamental epistemic question: _What can we know or understand differently as a consequence of practice-research?_ There are three research questions -- _Limits_, _Proxies_ and _Hyper-specificity_ -- with corresponding objectives as follows. 

_1. Limits: What are the epistemic limits of practice-research? What aspects of practices are not able to be known, understood or articulated?_

1. identify qualities of experience from first-person body-based practice experiments that resist being known, are deeply uncertain, or are unable to be articulated
2. identify qualities of experience from first-person body-based practice experiments that assist being known, display some quality of certainty, or are able to be articulated **add third-person here**

_2. Proxies: What are practice-research's common epistemic proxies and how do they affect the value of practice-research as an approach for developing new insights?_ 

3. in-depth survey of practice-research epistemology literature from the early 1990s (when practice-research began in the academy) to the present (building on unpublished work of Ken Friedman)
4. identify and critique any epistemic ambiguities/limitations/possibilities in this scholarship
5. identify epistemic proxies of practice-research -- these are the ways in which practice-research represents its understandings or findings while keeping them at arm's length
6. critical analysis of the affects of epistemic proxies on epistemic clarity and specificity in practice-research  

_3. Hyper-specificity: What language is used to express approaches, findings and failures in practice-research? How can this language be adapted in order to create increased critical dialogue between practice-research artist-scholars?_

7. collect and analyse language used by artist-scholars to describe their research findings, understandings, failures and ambiguities. 
8. modify and adapt this language in order to find ways of linking the epistemic status of previously distinct research projects
9. categorise and organise these qualities of experience into a lexicon of epistemic _findings and failures_ in practice-research


## Research methods 

### Which research methods?

The research methods described below are designed to realise the project objectives. The objectives, in turn, respond directly to the three wide-angle research problems -- _limits_, _proxies_ and _hyper-specificity_ -- which underpin the project's aim to address practice-research's fundamental epistemic question: What is known or understood differently as a consequence of practice-research methods? The following research methods are organised under the three overarching problems they address. 

**Is the practice in AHRC contributing to that discourse (around the body/AM/etc) or solely in service of PaR?** See for example <art practice and artistic research.md> in slip box. I have a feeling the AM is serving two masters. More importantly, what do I want it to do? Frayling's in, for and through useful here? 

1. _Limits:_ 

- **Empirical and experiential practice-research fieldwork**: 4 x 2 week blocks (20 hours per week) of Authentic Movement (body-based practice)  
- **Experimental documentation** developed through critical reflection and writing, and still and moving images
- **Empirical and sensorial analysis** through first and third-person observation of the practice to propose epistemic limits 
- **Scholarly writing**: first and third-person case report to communicate findings 

2. _Proxies_:

- **Literature and field research and review** of practice-research scholarship and practice to identify any epistemic patterns, ambiguities and proxies
- **Critical analysis** of these materials to develop a theoretical argument regarding the use of epistemic proxies in practice-research 
- **Scholarly writing** to communicate findings

3. _Hyper-specificity_: 

- **Systematic review and meta-analysis** of practice-research field to understand language used to express approaches, findings and failures
- **Critical analysis** of this language to design, propose and share a lexicon of epistemic findings and failures in practice-research

### Why these methods?

>Why have you chosen these methods? Why are they the best way to answer the research questions or problems you have identified? 

>Depending on the approach you are using throughout your research, you may also need to explain clearly the creative and/or performative aspects of the work, explain how you will develop a new process, product or tool, or provide details of who you have consulted or will be involved in the process of research.

The methods above contain reflection, empirical and critical analysis, writing, creative practice and documentation. They are designed to address the research questions from the inside through experimental practice-research, and the outside through more traditional scholarship. 

#### Experimental practice-research

The methodological heart of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is to use Authentic Movement (AM) as the basis for experimental practice-research fieldwork.

Authentic Movement is a process-oriented movement practice that specifically distinguishes the body as observed from the outside (third-person perspective) and the soma as perceived from the inside (first-person perception).[@hanna_what_1995 p.341] AM provides a structured body-based process of empirical (visible) and sensorial (non-visible) observation. Its focus is on _doing something_ rather than _making something_, and the practice dwells deeply in ambiguous feelings and thoughts, presents movement experiences that are not obviously visible and thereby complicated to document, and has an ambivalent relationship to the written word. Therefore, AM is an edge-case / paradigmatic way to examine the epistemic limits, possibilities and failings of body-based practice-research, and to propose extrapolations of these limits to other practice-research disciplines. The practice offers clear and precise limits necessary to wrestle with these fundamental questions of what can be known differently ...

>As Schwab thinks through the relationship between artistic research and contemporary art he proposes that we must move away from objects (not clear what he means by objects) with a "more or less stable historical identity"[@schwab_experimental_2019 p.166] to "more precarious, ambivalent, or provisional things."[@schwab_experimental_2019 p.166] -- support for use of AM?

In _Finger Pointing Moon_ the practice will involve three people. The first two (Ellis and Whalley) will work with an experimental form of the AM practice oscillating between the roles of _mover_ and _observer_. Over the course of the practice they will adapt it (including using first, second and third-person photography and videography)[e.g. @bedard_disembodied_2015] by experimenting with the limits and possibilities of observable and sensorial experience.[This method builds on earlier work by Ellis, -@ellis_corporeal_2020] The third collaborator (TBC) will act as an external observer to the entire practice. The three roles provide degrees of proximity to the empirical and non-empirical qualities of the practice-research.

The practice will be documented from _within_ via photography, videography, written and spoken reflections, and from _without_ via Pakes' detailed third-person observations and analysis.    


- add Varela’s thinking about first person experience (in zettel <first-person experience>) — see question and thoughts in there?

add something from Bob here about limited knowledges?

Skills as an artist-scholar ...
The ‘job in hand’ gives a further and complex insight into enquiries of bodies, and what lies in between / beneath / behind. The artist scholar is charged with the doing, (un)doing, of something. Some of the skills pertinent to the task ...
Ways of reading
Ways of understanding 
Ways of bodies
Temporary understandings
Understandings in flux
Embedded / entwined and limited knowledges. 

This ‘limited’ nature is an area of perhaps enhancement to artistic-scholarly practice (in yours, and others). Not in terms of filling the gaps, or as presaged understanding, but of what can be forgotten. So a different route to delimiting knowledge.

#### Traditional scholarship




### People and roles

>What will be your role? If there are other people involved, what will their roles be and why are they the appropriate people to be involved? 

PI: 
RA:
Anna Pakes:
Bob Whalley:


### Copyright or intellectual property issues

>Under the Research Methods heading you should also outline how any copyright or intellectual property issues relating to the project and the production of any outputs will be addressed.

## Development plan 

>This section of the Case for Support should include details of your proposed development activities, and an explanation as to why these activities are appropriate to helping you enhance capabilities as research specialists in your field. You should make clear how these activities enhance the transformational potential of the research and its broader influence and importance. Please refer to the Enhancing Research Capabilities in section 1.5 for further details on what is requirement for this section.(p.73)

>In framing your proposal, you will need to clearly articulate a set of activities and to demonstrate both how they will enhance your role within your field, and how they significantly develop your research and its broader influence and importance.(p.26)

>The activities outlined, which should be commensurate with your current career stage and trajectory, should go beyond the kinds of activities that researchers generally undertake in establishing themselves in their disciplines or in the ordinary course of their duties. In other words, the Fellowship offers the opportunity to be innovative in the types of activity which might be taken forward and allows Fellows to explore new avenues. Fellowship proposals should include a substantial programme of collaborative activities and you should be bold in thinking about what is needed to support them.

>When applying to this scheme, fellows will be required to articulate a set of development activities, to demonstrate how they will enhance their profile or status within their field, and how they will develop their research and its broader influence and importance.(p.101 Guide 4.9)

>-to develop capabilities as research specialists and to create opportunities for outreach beyond their research field;
>-to undertake innovative and collaborative development activities, including the initiation of new research, which will result in benefits for their own discipline(s) and beyond.

I have been an artist for 30 years, and an artist in the academy for 20 years. In this time, I have pursued and developed individual research practices that have led to small-scale and intimate outcomes. I recognise that my attention -- and perhaps ambition -- has been mostly inward and personal. 

The research component of _Finger Pointing Moon_ seeks to develop a new line of epistemic inquiry in practice-research by employing an experimental shift towards empiricism by which to test the boundaries of findings and claims in practice-research. The project's development plan is to use this new line of inquiry as a means to radically change my previously inward focus by developing a series of outward-facing communications-based activities that will test and improve my communication and advocacy skills beyond and within the academy. In order for practice-research to be more widely acknowledged beyond its own disciplinary fields, it is "necessary to consider and adhere to the demands of the larger academic community".[@biggs_eight_2008 p.15]

The development plan will help me acquire four new capabilities that will enhance my role within practice-research, and significantly develop the influence and importance of my research: 1) to communicate and contextualise niche and complex ideas about fundamental epistemics of practice-research beyond the field and also to the wider public; 2) to demonstrate leadership in methodological advances in practice-research; 3) to develop and support a broad cross-disciplinary community of active artist-scholars; and 4) to create a range of collaborative opportunities with academic and non-academic stake-holders within and and outside of dance and the performing arts. 

These four capabilities will be developed through four bold and innovative activities:

_1. Unforgettable_
This will be based on a practice of gathering and sharing community experiences of dance and movement. 

- inspiring creativity in other researchers
- wider impact
- new research partnerships and collaborations 
- unforgettable: gathering and sharing of community experience
    + invite and collect notes and letters from scholars, artists and wider public about first-hand "unforgettable" memories of dance
    +
    + catalogue these collected letters and responses into various kinds of works, responses, years, etc
    + understanding language of experience / expression
    + 
    + relationship of memory to our sense of knowing -- 
    + cataloguing process will result in a small-scale exhibition to be presented at various performance spaces around the world [output]

un/knowing body
- gathering then extending this work into the community
- state how these relate to the research (epistemics)
- fostering interdisciplinary research involving your field
- inspiring creativity in other researchers
- wider impact
- new research partnerships and collaborations 
    + collecting practice of materials, traces, ideas, notes, and thoughts on corporeal epistemics: _The Un/knowable Body_
    + gather materials throughout the research project
    + organise these materials into emergent patterns (based on not yet known characteristics) 
    + develop exhibition of these materials to be presented at movement research centres nationally and internationally [output]

discourse forum
- providing intellectual leadership / leading research networks
- inspiring creativity in other researchers;
- inspiring creativity and development in other researchers;
- shaping research agendas;
- encouraging new research collaborations and partnerships;

podcast
- inspiring creativity and development in other researchers;
- fostering interdisciplinary research involving your field;
- moving into a new field
- communications
- public engagement
- cross disciplinary practices, ideas, understandings

## Project management 

>How will the project be managed? What will be the roles of the members of staff involved (including you and, if applicable, any Co-Investigator(s), any research assistants)? What is the timetable for the project? Does it include appropriate milestones and is it realistic? When will the outputs of the project be completed? How will you ensure that they meet the needs of your audience? Can the 
costs be justified? How will you ensure good value for money? 
The project management section should also include the management of the digital and data management aspects of the projects, if applicable, and should be coordinated with the information in the Data Management Plan. It should be clear what the milestones for the completion of this element and the work should be incorporated into the timetable for the whole project. The project management of the data management aspects of the project should include an assessment of risk in relation to the complexity and delivery of the project.
If a postdoctoral researcher is to be employed, you should state clearly the nature of the work they will be undertaking and describe clearly the working relationships that are envisaged between all the 
members of the research team. You should describe fully the arrangements for supervising and managing the research assistant. If the researcher is unknown you should state the skills and qualifications sought. Similarly, if the project involves a visit to or a secondment from a member of staff from another organisation, you must state clearly what work they will pursue and describe the 
working relationships envisaged with other members of the team.
In terms of supporting the research staff funded on the project, you should clearly outline the development opportunities which the project will make available. These should include opportunities both in relation to research expertise, and wider opportunities, for example, in connection with the activities proposed in the Pathways to Impact statement.

- RA: website maintenance, and annotated bibliography of literature and practice (shared zotero library), published online as ongoing page on project website (with links to OA versions of originals where possible). edited collections (books) to be annotated by chapters. Or single page as database that includes one/two line summary of the publication/research. are we creating a database here? 
- 

- balance of research and development activities throughout the 18 months. recognising that they go hand in hand. ??

>Your Fellowship project can be up to 18 months (min at 0.5FTE max at 1.0FTE) but the research assistance can be up to a total 12 months of full time distributed over the 18-month period.
In other words, RA can work up to the maximum at (12/18) FTE for 18 months or 1.0 FTE for 12 months. 
See page 20, section Research Assistance. (from Amy)

## Outputs, Dissemination and Impact

>The Outputs, Dissemination and Impact section is your opportunity to describe in more detail how the potential impacts of the research will be realised. Information under this heading should build on details given in the Summary and Academic Beneficiaries sections of the Je-S form whilst also elaborating further on other areas of the Case for Support. You should address two main questions: who might benefit from the research and how might they benefit?

>Taking into account what is reasonable and appropriate given the nature of the research you propose to conduct, please provide examples of how the proposed research will be managed to engage any users and beneficiaries that have been identified, or to identify potential users and beneficiaries as the research progresses, and to increase the likelihood of achieving impacts. In presenting your plans, you should tailor and target your dissemination activities to ensure that they are relevant to the specific user and beneficiary groups likely to be interested in your research and appropriate for supporting the potential research impacts outlined.

>You should consider (and address if appropriate) methods for communications and engagement, collaboration and development. You should also detail who will be undertaking any dissemination activities and include any resource implications in the financial summary and in the separate Justification of Resources attachment. Please also explain further how the research will benefit other researchers in the field and – where relevant – academic beneficiaries in other disciplines.

- split between research activities (outputs) and developmental ones, and the possibility of managing this throughout the 18 months

_problems:_

_1. limits_

- OUTPUT 1: authentic movement: speculative and/or experimental documentation practices through writing and still and moving images **contribution here is more 'pure' practice-research in that it will be contributing directly through the practice to that community** [2] RES
- OUTPUT 2: third-person scholarly article [2] about epistemic limits - in collaboration with philosopher Katherine Hawley? Anna Pakes? [2] RES
- OUTPUT 3: _Unforgettable_ exhibition [2] DEV
- OUTPUT 4: _The Un/knowable Body_ exhibition [2] DEV
 
_2. proxies_

- OUTPUT 5: journal article on epistemic proxies [1] RES

_3. hyper-specificity_

- OUTPUT 6: lexicon of epistemological "findings and failures" [3] RES
    + like the emotion wheel
    + lexicon: "the vocabulary of a person, language, or branch of knowledge"

_4. W = whole project_

- these outputs should address (in some form) the overall aim. Can this aim allude to key aspect of communications or is that separate to the 'research'?

- OUTPUT 7: video essay: collates and articulates key concerns/findings of project [W] RES
- OUTPUT 8: 2 series of 8 episodes of podcast [W] DEV
    - 1. Series 1: limits of knowledge
        + experimental failures
        + what it means to know something
        + know-how: craft and practice
        + contradictory research
        + perception and perceptual error
        + describing what we know
        + the things we will never know
        + machine learning and AI
        + contemplation, meditation and enlightenment
        + taste (aesthetic knowledge)
        + conspiracy
        + truth and belief
    - 2. Series 2: limits of language
        + unsayable things
        + dance and language
        + gaps between different languages
        + when words fail us
        + swearing and cussing
        + language v direct experience
        + silence and contemplation
        + mutism
        + sign language
        + science of language
        + computer languages and coding

- OUTPUT 9: discourse forum: a site for students, potential students, artist-researchers, other disciplines; create with group of people from around the world: look to get 50-100 active users in first year [W] DEV
    + plan for maintenance and sustainability
- OUTPUT 10: 5 curated talks online (micro-conferences) [W - but curated towards each of 3 problems] DEV
    + e.g. [lesswrong.com/posts/9m9SniwdKsKyfjrMw/inviting-curated-authors-to-give-5-min-online-talks](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9m9SniwdKsKyfjrMw/inviting-curated-authors-to-give-5-min-online-talks)
    + these could be held by people who have contributed to the project blog or the podcasts? 
- OUTPUT 11: article for The Conversation [W] RES / DEV - **remove this**
- OUTPUT 12: project website and blog [W] RES

- OUTPUT 13: github site (radical transparency) [W] DEV
    + basically a downloadable version of all texts from the website

- key question for me here is how do non-academics benefit from this work? this is probably why that practice for theatre exhibitions is useful. It gets back to the Snowden thing.


+ Outputs and Dissemination (what you will do with the knowledge) for your audience:
    * To Beneficiaries – who are they
    * To End Users – who are they?
    * What is the plan to exploit outcomes to beneficiaries and end users (short description)
    * Will there be Public Engagement?

  


## other things to consider

- my skills and experience (competence)
- value: is the project good value? ? (mention resources, type and quantity/level needed justified in Plan)
