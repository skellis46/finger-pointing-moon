# Case for Support

Finger pointing moon: recognising change through practice-research

>... they see that language is only a finger pointing at the moon and not the moon itself.[@johnston_cloud_2012 p.2]

>Some aspects of the world may even be beyond the limits of our thought, so that we cannot form intelligible descriptions of them, let alone know that a particular description is true.[@markie_rationalism_2017 n.p.]

## The Research Problem and Questions

Practice-research has two fundamental epistemic questions: 1) What is known or understood differently as a consequence of practice-research methods? 2) How might these understandings be shared and articulated? The second question has been examined in detail through research into documentation and archives.[^doc] However, for nearly 30 years the first question has remained practice-research's most controversial and under-examined. The aim of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is to tackle this first fundamental epistemic question. 

The project's aim is underpinned by three epistemic conditions: i) _proxies_, in which artist-scholars rely on epistemic proxies to circumvent the messiness of noticing change (that is, acquiring knowledge or observing ways in which "our seeing, our expectations, and our thinking"[@noe_strange_2015, Chapter 11, n.p.] are reorganised) in practice-research; ii) _limits_, in which artist-scholars fail to examine the limits of what can and cannot be known through practice-research; and iii) _hyper-specificity_, in which practice-research understandings and methods are rarely in critical dialogue with each other. 

_Finger Pointing Moon_ has three research questions built on these conditions:

1. _Proxies_: What are practice-research's common epistemic proxies and how does their presence affect the value of practice-research as an approach to understanding the ambiguous and complex experiences of human artistic endeavour? 

2. _Limits:_ What are the epistemic limits of practice-research? What aspects of practices are not able to be known, understood or articulated?

3. _Hyper-specificity_: What language is used to express findings and failures in practice-research? How might this language be adapted in order to create increased critical dialogue between practice-research artist-scholars?

## Research context 

### Why is it important that the research questions are explored?

Practice-research is not a singular method but rather an overarching approach for working with creative practices in scholarly contexts. The approach has four key characteristics: i) it is first-person, and involves self-critical reflection, or _mesearch_;[@rees_self-reflective_2019] ii) it involves repetition through artistic practice;[@blythe_framework_2016] iii) it has a contested relationship to language and dissemination; and iv) it involves experiences that are ambiguous and/or hidden. These characteristics produce "fuzzy"[@borgdorff_conflict_2012 p.181] epistemic possibilities. Consequently, artist-scholars have an open secret: we usually conceive our research findings _a priori_ and/or present them _a posteriori_ as reflective spaces[@jeremy_bubb_missing_2020] using vague and hopeful.[^3examples]

The four characteristics outlined above are uniquely amplified for artist-scholars working with body-based practices. By _body-based_ I mean practices like choreography and somatics predicated on the movements, gestures, postures and stillnesses of bodies, and where those same bodies underpin the development of new understandings. What is unique for body-based practices in relation to the key characteristics of practice-research described above is that: they have a particularly complex and often fraught relationship with language;[@bauer_no_2019] the experiential nuances are not seen, but _felt_;[@ellis_corporeal_2020] the practices intersect with contested issues of embodiment and tacit awareness;[@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011; @kampe_body-soma-self_2019] and they further complicate problems to do with disappearance, ephemerality and documentation.[@ellis_indelible_2005; @ledger_question_2011] 

The conception, context and research design of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is therefore founded on two propositions: i) that there is a systemic failure in practice-research to attempt to apprehend the changes and differences made possible through research-focused artistic practices; ii) body-based practices provide a vital methodological lens through which to investigate the epistemic complexity of practice-research.

The three research questions form the spine of the project's focus for practice-research to adopt a more lucid relationship with its own epistemic possibilities, limitations and failings. The alternative to not addressing these questions is the status quo in which endless variations of process are circulated and fetishized,[^fetish] representational proxies are assumed to stand in for "epistemic things",[@rheinberger_toward_1997] outcomes are rarely explicitly made in dialogue with overlapping practices,[^theory] and there are no limits to unfalsifiable[^popper] claims to understanding and no limits to the vagueness of these claims. 

In short, if _all_ practice-research is presentable as _truth_ -- even in the sense that "truth is aspirational"[@ingold_search_2018] -- then it is broken as an approach to generating understanding. I have developed the research questions -- _proxies_, _limits_ and _hyper-specificity_ -- to examine and clarify an epistemology of  practice-research. Without epistemic edges, we diminish practice-research's value as an approach to recognising changes in understanding afforded by the complex experiences of human artistic endeavour. 

### Other research in this area

In 1992 the UK Higher Education Funding Councils first recognised the work of artists as research and, unsurprisingly given the potential "access to highly lucrative government funding",[@magee_introduction._2012 n.p.] art and artists quickly became invested in the production of knowledge. Since then, the epistemological project in practice-research has comprised various attempts to reverse-engineer art-making through an epistemological lens. That is, once art was recognised as research it became necessary to justify and validate its knowledge-producing bona fides, and to avoid a situation in which "the entire history of art [became] eligible for a postgraduate research degree."[@frayling_research_1993 p.5] 

#### The intrinsic-extrinsic debate

This project of creating epistemic justifications for practice-research has been characterised by a continuum bookended by two conflicting positions:[^40k] 1) artistic artefacts require a written statement that synthesises the epistemic status (findings) of the research;[e.g. @noauthor_ref2021_2019; @nelson_practice_2013] 2) artistic artefacts themselves contain and communicate research findings.[e.g. @borgdorff_conflict_2012] **note that these ends of continuum aline quite nicely with knowledge being located with the researcher or with the object**

[^40k]: For example, there is a curious contradiction in the UK that a practice-research PhD normally requires approximately 40k words of contextual writing, while a submission to the REF only requires a 300 word summary statement. 

Both positions have inherent problems. The extrinsic position -- that knowledge in practice-research is only revealed or clarified through written contextualisation[@bolt_magic_2007; @smith_practice-led_2009; @candy_role_2010] -- limits the role and importance of the artefact,[@magee_introduction._2012; @borgdorff_debate_2006; @candlin_proper_2000] and sets no margins on the epistemic claims that artistic-scholars make on behalf of their practices. Such claims are rarely "made available for sustained and verifiable peer review".[@haseman_tightrope_2007 n.p.; see also @candy_role_2010] The intrinsic position -- that knowledge is intrinsic to or "embodied in"[@borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.vi] artistic-research artefacts[@ellis_that_2018; @borgdorff_conflict_2012] -- positions ambiguity and uncertainty as epistemic values that usefully produce "less identifiable knowledge products."[@butt_performance_2014 p.114]. Such products act as points of epistemic resistance: they "resist academic conventions of accountability"[@borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.ix] or "ways of knowing that are not able to shape -- or be shaped by -- the various tools and systems of the knowledge economy."[@ellis_that_2018 p.490]  

The tension between intrinsic and extrinsic _claims to knowledge_ in practice-research looms over all practical and theoretical work in the field.[e.g. @borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.ix] It is a conflict founded on: i) the extent to which scholars _believe_ that language is needed to describe and justify claims to knowledge;[e.g. @berry_life_2001; @williams_mindfulness_2012] ii) differing perspectives on the limits of artistic practice outcomes to _hold_ and communicate understanding;[e.g. @stephen_scrivener_art_2002; @borgdorff_debate_2006] and iii) the contested relationship between artistic-scholarly outcomes and the pursuit of truth.[e.g. @noe_strange_2015; @ingold_search_2018] 

In _Finger Pointing Moon_ the intrinsic-extrinsic conflict will likewise loom over the project's methods, analysis and outcomes. The conflict is not a question to be addressed, but more akin to the historical epistemic air that the project is compelled to breathe. 

#### Past efforts to describe an epistemology of practice-research

- borgdorff (debate, 2006) -- good overview
>The epistemological issue of the distinctive character of art knowledge is also addressed by phenomenology, by hermeneutics and by the cognitive sciences.[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.14]

Mention (for each) how they might touch on the extrinsic-intrinsic continuum

>In sum, the knowledge embodied in art, which has been variously analysed as tacit, practical knowledge, as ‘knowing-how’ and as sensory knowledge, is cognitive, though nonconceptual; and it is rational, though nondiscursive. The distinctive nature of the knowledge content has been analysed in depth in phenomenology, hermeneutics and cognitive psychology.[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.15]

##### Equivalence

-- see that thing produced p.486

##### Know-how and technê

- pakes, Ryle, Carr, Polanyi, (Aristotle), 
- rarely made it clear -- or maintained the clarity (often flip-flopping) -- of where the understanding is located: work of art, understanding of researcher. Borgdorff unequivocal in saying it's located in the art:

>With what kind of knowledge and understanding does research in the arts concern itself? And how does that knowledge relate to more conventional forms of scholarly knowledge? The short answer to the first question is: knowledge embodied in art practices (objects, processes). The answer to the second question will provide a closer understanding of what ‘embodied knowledge’ may be.[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.13]

### My contribution to improving, enhancing, or developing creativity, insights, knowledge or understanding in the area


- draw together large range of ideas, opinions and histories that have attempted to handle the epistemology of practice-research
- where the large body of work has used (often by default) a relativist approach to making epistemic claims, my ambition is to incorporate rationalism, and empiricism
- to speak directly to the problems -- push through the fuzziness
- 

- proxy is very different from staring into the belly of not knowing. Accepting the possibility of not knowing or there are things that are not able to be known 
- I am not proposing evidence evidence evidence. Tension between evidence, and allowing the creative work to do its work.

- to address the idea that practice-research's place is an epistemic place (and not to stay within realm of techne). to know something differently. to know-that. this is not to reduce or displace know-how or craft. ties to Rheinberger and building epistemic things.
- but what is the nature of this epistemic place? can something that is unknowable (akin to Berry's thinking) be an epistemic thing? And if not, what kind of _thing_ is it? 
- some kind of line between what is observable and standpoint epistemology

interested not only in what we can agree on but what we can clearly disagree about on. what can't be said? some things must be open to debate (other than just methodology). Where is there legitimate disagreement? (heterotopic discourse -- ways of arguing) -- similar to Biggs and Buchler (2011) approach, p.83 of the chapter in their edited volume.

### Who will be most interested in the outcomes? 

- artist-scholars from various disciplines working in and through practice-research
- graduate and postgraduate students working in practice-research across disciplines
- philosophers / epistemologists
- body-based specialists grappling with understanding their work as potentially epistemic things (and claims to knowledge)


### Research objectives

The aim of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is to address practice-research's fundamental epistemic question: _What can we know or understand differently as a consequence of practice-research?_ This aim is addressed by three research questions -- _Proxies_, _Limits_ and _Hyper-specificity_ -- that are themselves underpinned by [XX] objectives as follows. 

_1. Proxies:_

1. complete in-depth survey of practice-research epistemology literature from the early 1990s (when practice-research began in the academy) to the present
2. identify and critique any epistemic ambiguities/limitations/possibilities in this scholarship
3. identify epistemic proxies of practice-research -- these are the ways in which practice-research represents its understandings or _findings_ while keeping them at arm's length
4. propose analysis of the affects of epistemic proxies on epistemic clarity and specificity in practice-research  

_2. Limits:_

2. _Limits:_ What are the epistemic limits of practice-research? What experiences and aspects of practices are not able to be known, understood or articulated?

5. identify qualities of experience from first-person body-based practice experiments that resist being known, are deeply uncertain, or are unable to be articulated
6. identify qualities of experience from first-person body-based practice experiments that assist being known, display some quality of certainty, or are able to be articulated 
6. categorise and organise these qualities of experience into a "lexicon of un/knowing in body-based practice-research"  

and discuss if required propose precise, clear alternatives that speak directly to the epistemic limits and possibilities of body-based practice-research 


_3. Hyper-specificity:_

7. _Hyper-specificity_: What language is typically used to express findings and failures in practice-research? How might this language be developed, adapted or reconfigured in order to create increased critical dialogue between practice-research artist-scholars and their projects?

8. generate set of epistemic principles underpinning body-based practice-research, with particular attention on findings, failures and indescribables

9. generate set of epistemic values in body-based practice-research that transparently and rigorously detail examples of "who, when [and] why is creating knowledge."[@mignolo_epistemic_2009 p.160]

10. examine the potential of proposed body-based epistemic principles and values to be generalisable to other forms of practice-research

## Research methods 

>What research methods will you be using to address the questions or issues that you have set yourself, or solve the problems you have identified, or to explore the matters you intend to investigate? Why have you chosen these methods? Why are they the best way to answer the research questions or problems you have identified? What will be your role? If there are other people involved, what will their roles be and why are they the appropriate people to be involved? 

>In describing your research methods it is not sufficient to state, for example, that you intend to visit a particular archive, or an exhibition abroad. You must provide adequate details of sources to be consulted, and you should state briefly what kinds of material you will be consulting, why they are relevant to your programme of research, and how you will interrogate them. Depending on the approach you are using throughout your research, you may also need to explain clearly the creative and/or performative aspects of the work, explain how you will develop a new process, product or tool, or provide details of who you have consulted or will be involved in the process of research.



>convince decision makers that ‘this is the best solution’ and feel compelled to fund it – (approx >50% of content); 

>Creative output can be produced, or practice undertaken, as an integral part of a research process as defined above. The Council would expect, however, this practice to be accompanied by some form of documentation of the research process, as well as some form of textual analysis or explanation to support its position and as a record of your critical reflection. Equally, creativity or practice may involve no such process at all, in which case it would be ineligible for funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council.(p.11)

### Why these methods? 

The research methods are designed to create the conditions in which to directly respond to and _achieve_ the project objectives. These objectives, in turn, feed directly into the three research problems, which underpin the primary research aim. The research questions -- _proxies_, _limits_, and _hyper-specificity_ -- are 'meta' or wide-angle problems in practice-research. The following methods are appropriate to the breadth of these problems, while affording detail where necessary. The methods are multi-modal, and comprise empirical practice-research fieldwork, lived experience as a dance artist-researcher, personal communications, interviews with key thinkers-practitioners and supplemental scholarly research to understand experiences and understandings of practice-research epistemics from the inside (through experimental practice) and the outside (through traditional scholarship). They are detailed below, and are organised under the three overarching problems they directly address.  

discuss body-based in this paragraph above

The three issues -- _proxies_, _limits_, and _hyper-specificity_ -- also act as a conceptual structure for the research design.

### Methods

1. _Proxies_: expert opinion, literature-based research

- Comprehensive literature review of body-based practice-research scholarship that emphasises embodied and tacit knowledge
- Critical and theoretical analysis of the language used in these scholarly (and practice-oriented) materials to identify any epistemic patterns, ambiguities and oversights
- Creative and analytical 'reconfiguration' (where necessary or appropriate) of these linguistic patterns that reveal the presence or absence of an epistemic proxy (in other words, what epistemic possibilities are not being discussed or are being glossed over?)  

2. _Limits:_ first-person and third-person case-report


link between first-person-ness of PaR and somatics; soma -- first person: <the field of somatics.md>.


- what might the "technologies of investigation"[@gramelsberger_laboratory_2013 p.104] be in par? 
- what do I imagine the objects of investigation to be in this work?

- clarify use of AM: what is it's function? how does it work? what claims can be made? the concept of efficacy is critical here? why this technique/practice and not another or others? This is based on reading [@ginot_shustermans_2010]

- traditional scholarship: literature and field (practice) review of published materials that implicitly and/or explicitly examine epistemics of body-based practice (some overlap of materials examined in Problem 1)**What do I do with this review? Need to add something here to this method**

    + develop annotated bibliography of 50-100 key published materials and present on project website [output] 
- practice-research: process-driven experimental movement practice as paradigmatic (or edge-case) example of epistemics limits and possibilities in practice-research 
    + practice will be 4 x 2 week sessions of Authentic Movement (four hours per day, 5 days per week = 20 hours per week). Authentic Movement is an edge-case example of practice-research because it is clearly process-orientated, dwells deeply in ambiguous or hard to pin-down feelings and thoughts, presents movement experiences that are not obviously visible and thereby effectively impossible to document, and has an ambivalent relationship to the written word
    + includes speculative and/or experimental documentation practices using still and moving images and written responses [output]
    + analytical reflection on the practice in order to propose what can and cannot be known about experiences in this practice, and other body-based practices more generally 
    + scholarly journal article that takes a quasi third-person perspective on this research: its limits, misses, problems, mistakes [output]
    
- practice-research: collecting practice of 'unforgettable experiences of body-based practice/performance', called _Unforgettable_
    + not at all clear how this practice relates to the RQs
    + invite and collect notes and letters from scholars, artists and wider public about first-hand memories of watching and doing dance and/or performance
    + catalogue these collected letters and responses into various kinds of works, responses, years, etc
    + cataloguing process will result in a small-scale exhibition to be presented at various performance spaces in the UK [output]
- practice-research: collecting practice of materials, traces, ideas, notes, and thoughts on corporeal epistemics: _The Un/knowable Body_
    + gather materials throughout the research project
    + organise these materials into emergent patterns (based on not yet known characteristics) 
    + develop exhibition of these materials to be presented at movement research centres nationally and internationally [output]

3. _Hyper-specificity_: systematic review and meta-analysis

systematic review and meta-analysis

- traditional scholarship: critically analyse the data sets from problem 2 to propose broad-ranging epistemic values and principles for body-based practice-research
    + pay particular attention to language of findings, failures and indescribables from literature and field review in problem 2 
    + collate this 'language of findings' in relation to Mignolo's proposition that we must focus on the knower (and not the known), and in particular "who, when [and] why is creating knowledge."[@mignolo_epistemic_2009 p.160]
    + propose sets of epistemic principles and values underpinning body-based practice-research [output]
    + categorise and organise these qualities of experience into a "lexicon of epistemology in body-based practice-research"[^wheel] [output] -- 



### People and roles


### Copyright or intellectual property issues

>Under the Research Methods heading you should also outline how any copyright or intellectual property issues relating to the project and the production of any outputs will be addressed.

## Development plan 

>This section of the Case for Support should include details of your proposed development activities, and an explanation as to why these activities are appropriate to helping you enhance capabilities as research specialists in your field. You should make clear how these activities enhance the transformational potential of the research and its broader influence and importance. Please refer to the Enhancing Research Capabilities in section 1.5 for further details on what is requirement for this section.(p.73)

>In framing your proposal, you will need to clearly articulate a set of activities and to demonstrate both how they will enhance your role within your field, and how they significantly develop your research and its broader influence and importance.(p.26)

>The activities outlined, which should be commensurate with your current career stage and trajectory, should go beyond the kinds of activities that researchers generally undertake in establishing themselves in their disciplines or in the ordinary course of their duties. In other words, the Fellowship offers the opportunity to be innovative in the types of activity which might be taken forward and allows Fellows to explore new avenues. Fellowship proposals should include a substantial programme of collaborative activities and you should be bold in thinking about what is needed to support them.


>First let’s establish that the concept of “individualization” should not be confused with the neoliberal ideology of “individualism” that shifts all responsibility for success or failure to a mythical, atomized, isolated individual, doomed to a life of perpetual competition and disconnected from relationships, community, and society. Neither does it refer to the psychological process of “individuation” that is associated with the lifelong exploration of self-development. Instead, individualization is a consequence of long-term processes of modernization.[@zuboff_age_2019 Chapter 2.2]

- thinking about individuation (relating to solitude) v individualism (opposite of Bendell)
- communications development will be key aspect of my approach/desire. why? within academy? what do we gain/lose from improved communications? wrestling with the bubbles. Comms will demand 

solitude and collective
use a practice -- it's how I come to understand things
+ practice-research: solitude practice (speculative _wildcard_)

solitude practice: One hour daily in solitude and silence - "doubts, or questions, or even just difficulties ... can only be found within--without distractions, without peer pressure, in solitude".[@deresiewicz_solitude_2010] This component is speculative and unknown. It's a wildcard. 



>we can be clearer about the kinds of actions that are useful to describe as “leadership” rather than something else, like “management” or “organising”. Leadership actions are those that help shift the way groups, networks or whole communities of people relate and so such actions generate effects over time. [@bendell_leadership_2019]



## Project management 

>How will the project be managed? What will be the roles of the members of staff involved (including you and, if applicable, any Co-Investigator(s), any research assistants)? What is the timetable for the project? Does it include appropriate milestones and is it realistic? When will the outputs of the project be completed? How will you ensure that they meet the needs of your audience? Can the 
costs be justified? How will you ensure good value for money? 
The project management section should also include the management of the digital and data management aspects of the projects, if applicable, and should be coordinated with the information in the Data Management Plan. It should be clear what the milestones for the completion of this element and the work should be incorporated into the timetable for the whole project. The project management of the data management aspects of the project should include an assessment of risk in relation to the complexity and delivery of the project.
If a postdoctoral researcher is to be employed, you should state clearly the nature of the work they will be undertaking and describe clearly the working relationships that are envisaged between all the 
members of the research team. You should describe fully the arrangements for supervising and managing the research assistant. If the researcher is unknown you should state the skills and qualifications sought. Similarly, if the project involves a visit to or a secondment from a member of staff from another organisation, you must state clearly what work they will pursue and describe the 
working relationships envisaged with other members of the team.
In terms of supporting the research staff funded on the project, you should clearly outline the development opportunities which the project will make available. These should include opportunities both in relation to research expertise, and wider opportunities, for example, in connection with the activities proposed in the Pathways to Impact statement.

>Your Fellowship project can be up to 18 months (min at 0.5FTE max at 1.0FTE) but the research assistance can be up to a total 12 months of full time distributed over the 18-month period.
In other words, RA can work up to the maximum at (12/18) FTE for 18 months or 1.0 FTE for 12 months. 
See page 20, section Research Assistance. (from Amy)

## Outputs, Dissemination and Impact

>The Outputs, Dissemination and Impact section is your opportunity to describe in more detail how the potential impacts of the research will be realised. Information under this heading should build on details given in the Summary and Academic Beneficiaries sections of the Je-S form whilst also elaborating further on other areas of the Case for Support. You should address two main questions: who might benefit from the research and how might they benefit?

>Taking into account what is reasonable and appropriate given the nature of the research you propose to conduct, please provide examples of how the proposed research will be managed to engage any users and beneficiaries that have been identified, or to identify potential users and beneficiaries as the research progresses, and to increase the likelihood of achieving impacts. In presenting your plans, you should tailor and target your dissemination activities to ensure that they are relevant to the specific user and beneficiary groups likely to be interested in your research and appropriate for supporting the potential research impacts outlined.

>You should consider (and address if appropriate) methods for communications and engagement, collaboration and development. You should also detail who will be undertaking any dissemination activities and include any resource implications in the financial summary and in the separate Justification of Resources attachment. Please also explain further how the research will benefit other researchers in the field and – where relevant – academic beneficiaries in other disciplines.

## edit bin

Use of the term exposition by Schwab and JAR. e.g. "Michael Schwab from the Royal College of Art in London for coining the term ‘exposition’ for this form of writing. Exposing practice as research amounts to assembling material—images, sounds, texts, artefacts— which together make a case, a claim, whereby the balance between words and other articulations may vary."[@borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.x]


>Any added discursive outcome is there to support, not replace, the artistic contribution the research claims to make.[@borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.vi]

"the three defining questions of epistemology"[@markie_rationalism_2017 n.p.]
- what is nature of knowledge?
- how do we gain it?
- what are the limits? 

To date, no research has directly examined the margins and intersections of these two positions in practice-research. 
The aim of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is to use a range of methods -- name them -- to examine the margins and intersections of intrinsic and extrinsic epistemics in body-based practice. 

I will use a range of methods -- empirical practice-research fieldwork, lived experience as a dance artist-researcher, personal communications, interviews with key thinkers-practitioners and supplemental scholarly research -- to examine the margins and intersections the intrinsic-extrinsic tension will percolate throughout the methods, analysis and outcomes.  

**What is missing from this section? Need to address proxies, limits and hyper-specificity in “other research” section?**

It reveals itself in common questions like, what work can the artistic work do?; what is the role of the writing in my practice? Do artistic artefacts communicate underis the relationship between the writing and the practice?  

Intrinsic and extrinsic epistemic positions also explicitly fail to recognise that research processes in all disciplines adopt the most suitable methods to recognise change or difference in the materials or data of those processes. When artist-scholars adopt practice-research methods it is therefore _implied_ but rarely stated that these methods are best able to reveal change and difference in the artistic materials, experiences and practices that underpin the research. Yet what types of changes or differences are _really_ made possible by practice-research and how are they able to be recognised if at all? 

artists just do practice-research because they are artists and p-r is what artists do in the university. **add here "When body-based practitioners ..."** add note about the method is often simply assumed -- I'm an artist, I therefore do practice-research. 

- early efforts: Pakes (know-how) Scrivener (apprehension)

Whereas in the early stages of the development of practice-research there was considerable focus on its epistemic underpinnings,[^under] since 2011 this scholarship has all but disappeared. At the same time there has been a sharp rise in scholarship using the ill-defined term _embodied knowledge_ (and its cousin _tacit knowledge_) as a concept to describe the epistemic value of (body-based) practice-research.[^ek1] 


The intrinsic position is particularly vulnerable to the development of epistemic proxies that stand in for the epistemic complexity, nuances and possibilities of practice-research. For example, in much practice-research, there has been a sharp rise in scholarship using the ill-defined term _embodied knowledge_ (and its cousin _tacit knowledge_) as a concept to describe the epistemic value of that research.[^ek1] Artist-scholars who research through movement practices have valorised and reified the concept of embodied knowledge; as if to say, the body knows and _ipso facto_ practice-research generates knowledge. An epistemic proxy does not address the epistemic complexity and limitations of practice-research, and keeps genuine changes in understanding at arm's length. Add point here about documentation being the critical proxy in practice-research (and connect to digital technologies? surveillance). This is because "proxies are easier to manipulate than the complicated reality they represent".[@oneil_weapons_2016 Chapter 3] -- related also to maps and territory, e.g. [lesswrong.com/s/5g5TkQTe9rmPS5vvM/p/RcZCwxFiZzE6X7nsv](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5g5TkQTe9rmPS5vvM/p/RcZCwxFiZzE6X7nsv)

- make clear that so much focus of practice-research has been on techne (know-how). Have argued previously that this is a given in any research practice: the capacity to do something, to have the know-how. But this is not the interests of any research method (or ought not to be). Example of science: know-how to filter chemical or run a regression. (unless process changes: development of epistemic thing)

>New knowledge generated by research, whether practice-based or not, is expected to have two characteristics: first that it is shared and second that it can be verified or challenged.[@candy_role_2010 p.121]


>This is how art has, on the one hand, got on the books as research these last twenty-five years, albeit by way of the artist-researcher’s exegetical accompaniment, with all sorts of pernicious effects on the artwork actually produced for the exercise and largely withdrawn from judgement in the process. It is also why there is so little love for the thing.[@magee_introduction._2012 n.p.]

In the early 2000s scholars attempted to make epistemic sense of practice-research through the standard account of knowledge as justified, true, belief, and through its relationship to phronetic know-how.[] Since then, 

>as Biggs argues, the artwork, and hence, the apprehensions, only exist within a context (Biggs 2003). The artwork alone, without text, cannot be seen as a research outcome.[@candy_role_2010 p.125]

>Practice-based art research can be about the creation of new apprehensions but any art object made as part of that research does not, by itself, embody knowledge. However, the text that accompanies the work may indeed illuminate new apprehensions or a new way of creating apprehensions that we can claim as the new knowledge produced.[@candy_role_2010 p.121]

- project website


To generate a flexible set of epistemic principles able to be used across disciplines and practices is a bold aim. It is also an aim that is founded on two seemingly paradoxical values that underpin the nature of leadership: authority and humility. In other words, _who_ has the authority to know, and _how_ might humility act to attenuate such authority? In _Finger Pointing Moon_ I will scrutinise the nature of authority in leadership by working with the radically analogue nature of the human body to examine _who_ gets to know, and _how_ they get to know. The project will be built on first-person research methods to deepen our understanding of two broad areas: creative practice-research, and leadership.

2. To interrogate leadership as a practice of humility, and examine how practices of humility, patience and listening play a role in construction of knowledge. 

- to understand leadership as a practice of humility  
- to build leadership as humility into understanding _who, when and why_ is constructing knowledge 
- focus on collective organising; strategies for collective organising: collecting practice? (this is the bit about 'people' from Bendell)
- leadership/practice connected by corporeal actions: what the body can do, and what the body does (fare: to make and to do)
- examine through practice the role of solitude in understanding leadership, action and change (contrast this with 'group epistemics' from That Thing Produced – actually, not in contrast. I think they sit together quite clearly. (see [@sennett_together_2012 p.21] -- about getting outside yourself)

But _Finger Pointing Moon_ is also a project in which the possibilities and limitations of leadership are built into the research design. It is a project _about_ leadership -- "a word to describe significant _actions_ enabling _change_ that is welcomed by affected _people_."[@bendell_leadership_2019] The concept and potential status of leadership is not a funding-led _container_ to bolster my claims to be a practice-research disciplinary leader. Rather, the overarching design is built around leadership that involves _actions_, _change_ and _people_. 

- add something here (or in paragraph after) about these three things (actions, change, people) - something about Bendell's thinking is about responding to the climate crisis. 

>"Epistemic things are the unknown, or vaguely known, objects of investigation that are the counterparts of experimental conditions (the technical objects). They do not simply yield in docile fashion to the technologies of investigation" (Mody and Lynch 2010, 3; see also Rheinberger 1997, 30-31). [@gramelsberger_laboratory_2013 p.104]

### Three underpinning epistemic problems in practice-research

#### 2 The Problem of What Can and Cannot Be Known

Practice-research has a long and important history with ambiguity. The _ways of knowing_ as represented by artistic artefacts inevitably involve messy and productive uncertainty; that when we are doing practice-research we are lost in the "mangle of practice".[@pickering_mangle_1995] This is the suggestion -- sometimes implicit, other times explicit -- that the epistemic essence of practice-research has only the _potential_ for meaning and understanding as a feature.[@ellis_that_2018] In other words, the epistemic work of artistic-research artefacts is to set in motion the possibility of understanding, the possibility of apprehension, the possibility of knowing differently. There are strong and important reasons for valuing research that pedals ambiguity. At the same time, there has been little if any concerted effort to recognise and/or articulate the epistemic limitations of practice-research: what are the things, experiences and sensations that cannot be known, understood or articulated? Between these two situations -- the ambiguity and messiness of what _might_ be known differently and what is not able to be known differently through practice-research lies the second problem underpinning _Finger Pointing Moon_. This second problem is the key epistemic paradox of creative practice-research: that its nature lies at least in part in what is _not_ able to be known, understood or articulated as a consequence of creative practices. **add here to specify in relation to body-based.** This is a humbling limitation for any research method or process. But it is also a limitation that is vital to examine and articulate in order to prevent _anything being possible or conceived of as 'knowledge'_ in practice-research. In order to understand what can be known and articulated through practice-research, we must attempt to understand what cannot. [which invites big big question about most appropriate or plausible method to deal with this question]

That artist-scholars who research through movement practices are failing to address the profound experiential changes and differences generated through practice, while valorising and reifying the concept of embodied knowledge; as if to say, the body knows and _ipso facto_ practice-research generates knowledge. 

using a thing to recognise changes in that thing.
changes in a cell wall — while also being the cell wall
inside and outside - feeling and felt - taster and tasted - 

think through this.
had to do with habits -- the capacity to notice change from first-person perspective. but even in somatics it's founded on support of external person. hence value of the observer in authentic movement.
- do I need a third-person perspective in the room? what about an anthropologist? or sociologist? someone trained in observation? 

we are not just inside and outside, we are inside something as it undergoing change. 
how do we experience change when it is happening to us? how do we apprehend difference (difference limen)? like frogs in water being heated up. or the air that we breathe.

#### 3. The Problem of Specificity

Generalisability is a key aspect of positivist research methods. That if we know _this thing or state_ about one (smaller) population or sample we can generalise that same thing or state to another (larger) population. Generalisability provides limited but vital powers of prediction. The opposite of generalisability is specificity. For example, in medical research specificity is generated by the power of case-studies. **Ginot's examination of this in somatics is useful here**. If a single case of a medical condition exists then it not able to tell us anything about a population, but it does tell us that this problem exists and that it is probable that it will exist in other people. 

Practice-research projects are, by and large, a series of hyper-specific case-studies. Each practice-research project is in effect a single case-study that is able to say only certain limited things about the experiences, practices and understandings in that specific project. At its best such specificity affords clarity, nuance and understanding. At its worst it creates insularity: a series of research bubbles that rarely touch each other, rarely talk to each other, and rarely even know of each other's existence. Research, by definition, involves critical and open dialogue with other similar or overlapping practices. The problem of specificity in practice-research is that its various ideas, methodological practices and understandings (or 'findings') are rarely if ever in open and critical dialogue with each other, and that this is possibly inevitable given the overly specific nature of individual research projects. A potential alternative to mitigate the problem of specificity in practice-research is to develop sets of epistemic principles and values that facilitate critical dialogues across projects and disciplines. (focus on language here -- like emotion wheel) 
- Batson[@batson_body_2014 p.8] mentions ungeneralizable nature of somatics experience

#### 1. The Problem of Proxies

- it's possible that the aim of this part is about understanding and revealing the proxies implicit (and specific) to PaR, and offering alternatives, or strategies for recognising, or strategies for acknowledging. But proxy of embodied knowledge (closely related to know-how) is perhaps the biggest of them all. 
- they are also efficient (like maps and territory), and useful. But need to be questioned

Is embodied knowledge the only proxy I can think of? Are there others? That this is just an example of one -- that is peculiar to body-based practice-research? actually, "knowledge" is the real proxy. we generate knowledge. we are knowledge producers! I'd say "process" is a proxy as well. Also "video evidence". What other 'fingers' are there pointing at the moon? Berry suggests language is also such a proxy: <human experience and language.md>. We forget that they are proxies (akin to Heidegger's enframing, and relationship to Borgmann's _focal things_

The complexities -- and sometimes impossibilities -- of articulating what is understood differently through practice-research may have created another distinct problem. Whereas in the early stages of the development of practice-research there was considerable focus on its epistemic underpinnings,[^under] since 2011 this scholarship has all but disappeared. At the same time there has been a sharp rise in scholarship using the ill-defined term _embodied knowledge_ (and its cousin _tacit knowledge_) as a concept to describe the epistemic value of (body-based) practice-research.[^ek1] Could it be that these two phenomena are related: that in the place of scholarship directly exploring the epistemics of practice-research, artist-scholars have replaced it with a proxy? That artist-scholars who research through movement practices are failing to address the profound experiential changes and differences generated through practice, while valorising and reifying the concept of embodied knowledge; as if to say, the body knows and _ipso facto_ practice-research generates knowledge. An epistemic proxy does not address the epistemic complexity of practice-research, but rather what can be understood differently through practice-research is kept at arm's length. After all, "proxies are easier to manipulate than the complicated reality they represent".[@oneil_weapons_2016 Chapter 3] In _Finger Pointing Moon_ I seek to understand the extent to which the proxy of embodied knowledge is blinding artist-scholars to the _reality_ of the underlying limits and possibilities of body-based practice-research. Without epistemic clarity, practice-research's value as an approach to understanding the ambiguous, messy and complex experiences of human artistic endeavour are diminished. **You hint at value here. I think you need something upfront on value/impact/importance etc.**


I will use body-based practice as a research lens because they represent an edge-case of the epistemic limits and possibilities of practice-research: they 

In this research I propose to use body-based practice-research as a lens through which to critically examine the diverse collection of methods that comprise practice-research. 

_Finger Pointing Moon_ examines what we can come to know or understand differently through body-based practice-research. 


>The distinction may not perfectly map onto the distinction between knowledge-how and knowledge-that, especially if Aristotle is taken at his word that what distinguishes epistêmê is what it is knowledge of: what “cannot be otherwise than it is” (Nic. Eth. 1139b.20). 

>epistêmê in Aristotle's strict sense: scientific knowledge of what cannot be otherwise than it is -- what is necessarily so.[@fantl_knowledge_2012]

>For Ryle, then, to know how to do something is to be disposed to behave in certain ways, and it's going to be very hard to specify in advance what those ways are. It will depend on the situation and on what the goals of the knower are.[@fantl_knowledge_2012]

-- points to my research know-how but not knowing specifically those ways. To be adaptive. 

The tension between intrinsic and extrinsic epistemics is felt most sharply in body-focused practice-research like dance and somatics. Body-based practices acutely feel the tension between intrinsic and extrinsic ways of knowing ... Therefore, body-based practices = ideal vehicle. 

Curiously, both intrinsic and extrinsic positions are often inadvertently supported in journals devoted to practice-research. This is the case when the _contextual writing_ refers to the epistemic ambiguity of the artistic artefact and the desire to let the art work do the work.

e.g. the writing refers to the ambiguity and letting the work do the work More common is simply to describe a research process (see JAR V20 - and lift any number of quotes from <reflections on JAR.md>)

"writing and theorisation surrounding the artwork [are] crucial to its fulfilling all the functions of research"[@smith_practice-led_2009 p.7]

If it is "the search for truth that underpins research"[@ingold_search_2018] then, even under the conditions in which "truth is aspirational",[@ingold_search_2018] practice-research's relaxed attitude towards falsifiability (and the truth) is a serious problem. Hence, the diverse range of outcomes artist-scholars state as research _findings_ are often at best conceived _a priori_, or at worst simply made up. 

this is because it hasn't yet happened built on assumptions and proxies.
it's important because currently we generate unfalsifiable outcomes in which anyone can say anything, and that are rarely explicitly built on or around other overlapping practices. But what do we get or gain from something different? 

- is anything not able to be claimed? is anything not 'presentable as truth'? what are the limits? at what point would a reader guffaw? (reminded here of that experiemnt to get fake papers published)

We have situation where most practice-research is about sharing what happened (or what they did). Circulations of process. Fetishization of process (e.g. REF -- pick your year). JER does this for sure -- except it's process that has been videoed. 

that this systemic failure has complex ramifications for artist-scholars working with body-based practices, and as such these practices 

In body-based practices like dance and somatics, the four characteristics above are uniquely amplified. These are practices predicated on the movements, gestures, postures and stillnesses of bodies, and where those same bodies underpin the development of new understandings. For such practices, 

The underpinning practices are diverse, distinct and often presented as singular or one-off projects. 

variously known as practice-research, practice-led research, artistic research, practice-based research and practice-as-research. It is 

_Finger Pointing Moon_ is predicated on two propositions: i) that there is a systemic failure in practice-research to even attempt to address the changes and differences made possible through research-focused artistic practices; ii) 

-- and the historically tenuous footing of practice-research inside the Academy -- 

In _Finger pointing moon_ body-based practice-research will function as a case-study through which to examine and understand three underpinning epistemic problems **Why are these problems? These problems are more aimed at body-based, not practice-research in general** in practice-research to do with 'new knowledge' or 'new understandings': 1) The problem of the proxy; 2) The problem of what can and cannot be known; 3) The problem of specificity. These 

delimit to body-based. but make an aim to consider relationship to practice-research generally.
- delimited to body-based practice-research as methodological strategy. 

Langer's thinking about experience without symbolic mediation is pretty important here: <without symbolic mediation.md>: 

>It may seem strange that the most immediate experiences in our lives should be the least recognized, but there is a reason for this apparent paradox, and the reason is precisely their immediacy. They pass unrecorded because they are known without any symbolic mediation, and therefore without conceptual form. -- Susanne Langer, Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling, Vol. 1, 1967.

>You should describe the research context for your project/programme of work. Why is it important that these questions or issues are explored? What other research is being or has been conducted in this area? What contribution will your project make to improving, enhancing, or developing creativity, insights, knowledge or understanding in the chosen field of study? To whom will the outcomes of your research be of particular interest?

There has been no systematic research directly examining ... 

This has particularly been the case in practices that are predicated on the limits and possibilities of the human body.

- got me thinking about the danger in this project of going so far out (ie requiring such a wide-angle) in understanding principles of properties that they become useless. that it is specificity that is utterly critical to practice-research. 
- good reason to delimit to body-based ... 

- general problem in practice-research
- body-based as paradigmatic example of complexity of problem
- generate claims/principles that speak directly to body-based
- such claims may be useful or appropriate to practice-research generally but cannot know this. My desire yes. but can't be sure. if the principles and values are so zoomed out then they might become useless. specificity is a key principle -- could use this as example. (Galloway's lists)
- no desire to create another 'overarching' method like Nelson

I seek to understand the extent to which the proxy of embodied knowledge is blinding artist-scholars to the _reality_ of the underlying limits and possibilities of body-based practice-research. Without epistemic clarity, practice-research's value are diminished.

This line of inquiry has fallen away or disappeared and it is not clear why. In more embodied creative practices (like dance, performance, live-art), the concept of _embodied knowledge_ has emerged as a form of epistemic proxy or red herring, 

. But even if it is correct to suggest that the 'body knows' (whatever this might mean), such a statement sheds little if any light on understanding the effects of working with and through practice-research. Therefore, the epistemic limits and possibilities of practice-research remain profoundly unclear. 

There is an epistemic crisis in body-based practice-research. In much of that research, the idea that the body _knows_ acts as a proxy for the epistemic limitations of practice-research investigations. In other words, 

Need to ask this as a question. That is -- not something I already think/believe. Recognise that embody is a term used loosely (can draw on definitions here), but analysis of how it is used, and potentially what is not being said. This is a kind of 'meta' or high-level approach.

>Have we somehow conspired to arrange matters so that knowledge is always what we say about something rather than what we show about it? [@biggs_editorial_2002]

By addressing these problems I aim to produce epistemic values and principles for body-based practice-research (but might be able to be extended beyond )

The contemporary cultural backdrop for the tension between embodied knowledge, the unknowable, and the inarticulable is the datafication of human experience. In 2017 _The Economist_ declared that the "world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data". We live in the age of _surveillance capitalism_ that is founded on "extractive operations in which our personal experiences are scraped and packaged as the means to others’ ends". The cultural and financial capital of understanding the world-as-data means it is not surprising that precarious and delicate artistic practices and processes located in and through the body – like dance and somatics – have also become enamoured by the doctrine of datafication. The rapidly growing number of online archives, digital forms of documentation, and virtual and augmented reality projects are all implicit or explicit attempts by dance scholars to transform the radically analogue nature of embodied experiences into data. 

is underpinned by these two phenomena: the limitations of embodied practice-research, and the datafication of experience. These phenomena are related because the construction and production of knowledge in any scholarly field is never based on the simple and objective observation of worldly phenomena. Rather, to understand what we say we know and do not know, the vital epistemic question is in fact "who, when, [and] why is constructing knowledges?" If the overwhelming contemporary phenomenon is the extraction of data from human experiences, then the question of _who, when and why is constructing knowledges_ necessitates an encounter with the limits and excesses of datafication. 

In this project, I propose that complex and radically analogue human experiences like experimental choreographic and movement practices have ontologies that are underpinned by two key characteristics: a) they defy the capacity to be accurately and wholly articulated and shared; and b) they exceed "algorithmic description".[@odell_how_2019] _Finger Pointing Moon_ is positioned squarely at the intersection of the datafication of human experience and the limitations of embodied practice-research. 

_Finger Pointing Moon_ is a project designed around creative practices that resist datafication, understanding and articulation, and the overarching purpose of the design is to create the conditions in which to develop an original set of practice-research epistemic principles (and also set of values). How does this aim relate to datafication? More like it's something to push against -- that it acts as a 'measure' of utility and function. That if something resists that process, it reveals things about the nature of that _something_. This makes the concept of datafication a methodological (and conceptual/theoretical?) strategy. A kind of thought experiment.

3. any examples of creative practice projects that explicitly or implicitly explore epistemology

The areas overlap because of potential for leadership to be understood as a practice of epistemic humility. add something here about affecting change (Bendell). something about it being comprehensive.

- make the language of these match with end of previous paragraph

1. To explore the limits of embodied practice-research, situated within the broad contemporary context of the datafication of human experience.

- to develop an original and comprehensive set of practice-research epistemic principles
- to generate and critically examine three research practices for which their epistemic possibilities are radically different. 
- research and produce annotated bibliography of PaR literature that refers to its history and its epistemic possibilities and limits
- epistemic principles in practice-research
- epistemic values in practice-research 

- Primarily a first person investigation:[^1st] to grapple with first person experiences in, through and around the body (my body) – to fully wrestle with the uncertainty and unsayable experiences that carve into our flesh

- creative practice-research fieldwork
- history, philosophy
- qualitative research through ethnographic conversations



1. develop two paradigmatic cases of the problem of knowledge production in PaR generally, and in dance specifically: 1) creative practice without outcome (process oriented) - authentic movement; 2) movement art work as film: package-able, shareable, digital, potentially circumvents the _problem_ of documentation
- how are they paradigmatic (either end of spectrum related to production of research practice outcomes)?

[^fetish]: Add list here incling J. of Embodied Research, JAR, and any version of REF. Not surprising because mostly artist-scholars are artists who end up in the university and just want to get to do their practice. The 'market' of journals is simply responding to the desires of artist-scholars

[^3examples]: Here are three brief examples from V20 of JAR (emphasis added): " ... _hopefully_ as you continue to read and listen, _it will become gradually clearer_";[@andrew_miller_exploring_2020] "the open-endedness of artistic research _allows the possibility_ for the ongoing development of _new insights_ among the wider community of creative practitioners";[@edmund_hunt_composition_2020] and "with this text I’m really _not trying to make any grand statements_. It is a _collection_ of words and decisions that function more as a _demonstration_".[@paul_norman_click_2020]

[^theory]: practice-research has (of course) a long history with building relationships with theory. Not as a way to oppose, confront or build theoretical understandings, but more as a way to prop up the academic status of the work. 

[^popper]: Need to be careful here as am calling on a whole different epistemic branch.

[^under]: Add list here of projects dealing with epistemic knowledge? e.g. Pakes, Scrivener,
