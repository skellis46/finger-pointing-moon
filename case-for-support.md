# Finger pointing moon: recognising change through practice-research 

## The Research Problem and Questions

Practice-research is the de-facto means by which artist-scholars make claims for new knowledge in the Academy. However, "no epistemology of artistic research has yet been produced."{1} _Finger Pointing Moon_ uses three research questions to tackle the problem of what is known differently when artist-scholars use practice-research methods:

_RQ1 Limits:_ What are the epistemic limits of artistic practice-research? What aspects of practices are not able to be known or articulated? 

_RQ2 Proxies_: What are practice-research's common epistemic proxies and what is their effect on the significance of practice-research as an approach for developing new insights? 

_RQ3 Hyper-specificity_: How can the language used by artist-scholars to express approaches and findings be adapted to develop increased dialogue across their research findings and outputs?

_Finger Pointing Moon_ is an ambitious project designed to re-shape the epistemic function of practice-research by drawing imagination-rich artistic practices and allied methods into contact with empirical observations of body-based movement practices. In doing so, it will provide the foundations for practice-research to boldly assert its place in the academy both in and of itself and in relation to other disciplines. The PI's outstanding experience and leadership in practice-research over 20 years make him ideally placed to realise the project's ambitions.

The research aims to deepen understanding of the epistemic limits of the body, while seeking to delimit the epistemics of practice-research. Having no limits preserves the status quo in which an enclave of artists in the academy produces unconnected cells of knowledge that are unable to be substantiated. Limits afford epistemic bridges with other communities of research. _Finger Pointing Moon_ will pave the way for practice-research to climb out of solipsism and into dialogue with knowledge claims of other arts and humanities disciplines. Such claims speak directly to the value of the arts and humanities in understanding all human endeavour, and particularly how humans make things. The diverse outputs proposed in the research and development components of the fellowship build on the PI's unique standing in the academic and professional communities, and also acknowledge the value of epistemic concerns and "epistemic well-being"{2} to the wider public.

## Outputs

_Finger Pointing Moon_ is a research (RES) _and_ developmental (DEV) fellowship proposal. The outputs respond to the project's aim to deepen understanding of the epistemic limits of the human body, and of practice-research itself. The outputs also contribute to the overall developmental component of the fellowship, which is to enhance the PI's impact, communication and public engagement capacities. The engagement-focused development component will draw professional and academic artistic communities into dialogue, and strengthen how practice-research can grapple accessibly with complex ideas through traditional and non-traditional outputs.

## Research context 

### Why is it important that the research questions are explored?

_Finger Pointing Moon_ adopts empirical practice-research fieldwork as a starting point to test practice-research's epistemic possibilities, limitations and failings. The RQs are designed to examine the problem of knowledge in practice-research by exploring how: i) variations of process are circulated and fetishized;{3} ii) representational proxies are assumed to stand in for "epistemic things";{4} iii) outcomes are rarely explicitly made in dialogue with other overlapping practices;{5} and iv) there are few if any limits to the epistemic claims made on behalf of practice-research.{6}

### Other research in this area

Past work to describe an epistemology of practice-research has been theoretical. The concepts of practical knowledge (_technê_) and know-how have been evoked to understand artistic-research specific epistemics.{7} This work has failed to distinguish know-how in practice-research from know-how in any research discipline,{8} and has not made it clear if practice-research knowledge is in the artistic artefact and/or with the researcher. 

Key theoreticians Scrivener and Borgdorff have separately focused on the limits of the artefact in practice-research and drawn the art object's audience into the issue -- Borgdorff through hermeneutics, and Scrivener by arguing that artefacts require interpretation.{9}  

Other work has built on Scrivener's idea that the audience is central to the epistemic project of practice-research. Rather than producing knowledge itself, the artist produces "a compelling, mesmerising question"{10} and the artefact affords understanding in the audience.{11} 

### My contribution to the area

The research design of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is based on two propositions: i) that practice-research is not adequately tuned to recognise changes resulting from research-focused artistic practices; ii) body-based practices provide an ideal methodological lens through which to investigate the epistemic complexity of practice-research.

_Body-based_ practices like choreography and somatics are unique because they have a complex and often fraught relationship with language;{12} the experiential nuances are not seen but felt;{13} the practices intersect with contested issues of embodiment and tacit awareness;{14} and they further complicate problems to do with disappearance, ephemerality and documentation.{15} 

_Finger Pointing Moon_ will move from deep inside body-based practice towards disciplinary-level theory. The theory will draw practice-research out from behind technê and epistemic proxies to understand the margins of practice-research epistemic things. It will also examine the set of epistemic beliefs that implicitly sustain practice-research. This will mean proposing language for an evidence-based epistemic approach to practice-research while accepting that there are things in practice-research that resist understanding and transmission. The goal here is to explicitly wrestle with the central _chiasm_ of knowing and questioning in practice-research; to acknowledge and enter into the border epistemic situations -- the profound conceptual ambiguities nestled deeply in the practices -- that stubbornly refuse to cooperate with the more tidy epistemic lines of the Academy.

### Who will be most interested in the outcomes? 

The research outcomes will be most interesting to arts and humanities scholars working with practice-research, and those outside the discipline exploring the role of creativity in generating research problems and solutions and/or working with non-traditional forms of presenting research outcomes. The research will also be valuable to epistemologists who are researching epistemic edge-cases. The practice aspects of the research will help body-based research specialists grapple with the epistemic potential of their work, and in relation to embodied and tacit knowledges. The developmental components of the project (see Development Plan) are designed to enhance the scope, reach and impact of the research for non-academic beneficiaries. 

## Research methods 

### Which research methods?

The research methods are: **practice-research fieldwork**, 2 x 3-week blocks (20 hours per week) of Authentic Movement; **experimental documentation** developed with writing and still and moving images; **empirical and sensorial observation** through first and third-person observation of the practice; **systematic literature and field review and meta-analysis** of practice-research to identify epistemic patterns, ambiguities and proxies, and to understand languages used to express approaches and findings; **critical analysis** of materials to develop understanding of epistemic proxies in practice-research, and to design and share a lexicon of epistemic findings and failures in practice-research; and **scholarly writings** to understand and communicate findings.

### Why these methods?

The methods address the research questions from the inside through _experimental practice-research_, and the outside through _traditional scholarship_: 

#### Experimental practice-research

The methodological heart of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is an experimental form of Authentic Movement (AM) deployed as practice-research fieldwork.

AM is a process-oriented movement practice that distinguishes the body as observed from the outside and the soma as perceived from the inside. It provides a structured body-based process of empirical (visible) and sensorial (non-visible) observation. The slipperiness of contemplative practice like AM, often beyond the reach of language and complicated to document, is essential to the project. In _Finger Pointing Moon_ AM is a prototypical methodological system through which to observe the epistemic limits and possibilities of body-based work, and to propose extrapolations of these limits to other practice-research disciplines. 

In the practice Ellis and Whalley will work with AM and share roles of mover and observer. While working they will adapt the practice (including using first, second and third-person photography and videography) and experiment with the limits and possibilities of observable and sensorial experience. Kneebone will act as an external observer to the practice. The three roles afford degrees of proximity to the empirical and non-empirical qualities of the practice-research, and provide the means by which to excavate what lies in-between and behind the artistic practice.

The practice will be documented from within via photography, videography, written and spoken reflections, and from the outside by the third collaborator's observations and analysis.  

In _Finger Pointing Moon_ the artistic practice will be a research outcome [O1] and then applied as a research object to underpin the other research methods, outputs and outcomes.  

#### Traditional scholarship

The experimental practice-research fieldwork will be supplemented by traditional _desk-based_ scholarly methods as listed above in _Which research methods_. These methods will make it possible to extrapolate the field-based data (the focus of RQ1) to cross-disciplinary outputs and outcomes that explore the epistemic failures and possibilities of practice-research (RQ2 and RQ3). The traditional scholarly methods will contextualise and broaden the value of the artistic fieldwork.

The experimental and traditional methods address 
the focus of the research component of _Finger Pointing Moon_: the epistemic limits of practice-research. The PI will build on these research methods through curatorial and public engagement processes in the development component of the project (See Development Plan). The research and development components together address the project's overarching aim to deepen understanding of the epistemic limits of the human body. 

### Copyright or intellectual property issues

There are no unusual copyright or IP issues except for the two curated exhibitions [O3,O4]. The exhibition materials will be attributed with permission from original authors and/or Creative Commons licensed. The Discourse forum [O9] will be a public online space that requires users to sign-up. It will be moderated to ensure no copyright laws are broken.

## Development plan 

The PI has been an artist for 30 years, and an artist in the academy for 20 years. The project's development plan draws on knowledge gained through the research component and the PI's broad artistic-scholarly experience, and applies them to epistemically-informed situations that impact artists and the wider public. The plan will consolidate his role as an international leader in practice-research and expand the importance of his research to communities of interest by helping him acquire four new capabilities: 1) communicate niche epistemic ideas in practice-research beyond the field to public communities in the arts; 2) demonstrate leadership in methodological advances in practice-research; 3) develop and support a broad cross-disciplinary community of active artist-scholars; and 4) create collaborative opportunities with academic and non-academic stake-holders. 

These four capabilities will be developed through four bold community-driven activities (outputs):

_1. Unforgettable_ [O3] will be an exhibition of materials from a practice of gathering experiences of dance and movement. Artists, scholars and audiences from around the world will be contacted through local and international organisations to send writing that describes a single unforgettable experience in dance. The process will encourage artists and audiences to use personal links and networks to pass on the idea. The written documents will be curated into an exhibition by working with artists and audiences associated with project partner Siobhan Davies Studio in England. _Unforgettable_ builds on the research's epistemic narrative by foregrounding the role of memory in knowledge generation. The process and exhibition are designed to: i) inspire creativity in how other researchers understand and represent the scope of their largely theoretical undertakings; ii) seek wider impact by ambitiously engaging a broad cross-section of participants; iii) develop a new and formal research-informed partnership and collaboration with a non-academic organisation in the UK, and informal collaborations with people who submit materials from around the world.

_2. The Un/knowable Body_ [O4] will involve collecting a large quantity of cross- and inter-disciplinary audio-visual-text materials that reveal the limits, margins and possibilities of human understanding of the body. The materials will be gathered by the PI and RA and then sent to project partners in Australia and Italy. Both partners will work with their local communities -- in consultation with the PI -- to explore ways to organise the materials and then develop a bespoke programme of events that explore knowledges of the body. _The Un/knowable Body_ explores a key part of the research component of _Finger Pointing Moon_ by describing what is known -- and what remains unknown -- about visual and sensorial experiences of the human body. The activity will: i) foster interdisciplinary research by working with and presenting materials from across disciplinary boundaries; ii) inspire creativity in other researchers by creating models for public engagement that emerge from those publics (rather than top-down or researcher focused models); iii) create wider impact for the research aspects of the project by building relationships between theoretical (and niche) ideas to do with epistemology with accessible and meaningful materials for the wider public; iv) create new research partnerships and collaborations between the PI and project partners.

_3. Artistic Research forum_ [O9] will create and support a broad cross-disciplinary community of scholars and artists working with practice-research. It will be an online Discourse Forum{16} that will modernise old-style email-based list-servs like PARIP, and act as a large-scale _conversation_ on historical, current and future thinking, practices and understandings of practice-research. The forum will be sustained by the discourse community itself with moderation from a group of experienced and emerging artist-scholars from around the world. In the initial stages, this group will engage users through their personal networks to help generate interest and momentum. The forum will, in effect, be an open access collaboration across the entire practice-research community. This is an ambitious activity that will: i) enable the PI to provide intellectual leadership through an openly accessible network of artist-scholars; ii) inspire creativity and development in other researchers both through materials posted to the forum and through its open and collaborative form; iii) help shape research agendas in which the forum acts like a town-square environment where vital conversations are easily heard and contributed to (e.g. output [O10] curated talks); iv) encourage new research collaborations as contributors engage with the materials and ideas presented in the forum; v) strengthen quality of individual research projects by exposing them to debate and dialogue through the forum.

_4. The Point Beyond_ [O8] is a podcast about human limits. It will comprise two series of eight episodes, and each episode will be a conversation with an expert that explores various points beyond which our understanding and experience is compromised. The two series will be _limits of knowledge_ and _limits of language_. _The Point Beyond_ attempts to take the research heart of _Finger Pointing Moon_ -- the limits and possibilities of human understanding -- and extrapolate that work into other areas. It will: i) inspire creativity and development in other researchers by building broad cross-disciplinary and wider-public interest in ideas that matter to how we understand being human; ii) foster inter- and cross-disciplinary research involving artistic research by building lively and focused conversations with other experts; iii) challenge the PI's ability to communicate complex ideas to a broad audience; iv) focus on clear public engagement: why do these niche and largely theoretical ideas matter and to whom? 

## Project management 

### People and roles

The project will be managed by Ellis (PI, 0.5FTE months 1-12, 0.8FTE months 13-18) working with a Research Associate (0.6FTE, 18 months). The PI is experienced managing academic and artistic teams, research projects and collaborating with industry partners. He will oversee the research methods, supervise and participate in the practice fieldwork and be responsible for management of research outputs. He will manage the collaborative work with the project partners to ensure the outputs are curated to meet the needs of the partners' audiences, and his own capability development goals. The practice fieldwork requires expert input from Joanne 'Bob' Whalley and Roger Kneebone. Whalley is an experienced artist-scholar working at the forefront of experimental documentation and writing practices. She will work with Ellis in the fieldwork as an expert practitioner and novice authentic movement practitioner -- an ideal insider-outsider perspective. Kneebone is a renowned professor of surgical education, whose recent work has focused on expert practices across the sciences and arts. Kneebone's role will be third-person observation, documentation and analysis of the practice fieldwork. Both will contribute to [O1] and [O2]. 

The RA will support the project through bibliographic research, drafting scholarly outputs, event and output organisation, and data and website management. The RA will be line managed by the PI. They will use an online project delivery system supplemented by weekly meetings to review progress and make milestone adjustments. The PI will balance the RA's ongoing professional development with project delivery. The goal will be to help the RA develop the skills and experience to pursue their own research agenda after project completion. The RA will have a practice-research PhD, and will be experienced in bibliographic research, writing and editing; they will be an excellent verbal and written communicator and have advanced digital literacy. 

There will be a four-person Advisory Group that will meet remotely with the PI at six-month intervals to provide high-level guidance: Efrosini Protopapa, Sarah Whatley, Charlotte Waelde and Lee Miller. CovUni will allocate additional administrative support to the PI for purchasing, finances and technical support when required.

### Timetable and milestones

See the Workplan attachment (Ellis_SK_Workplan.docx) for monthly breakdown of planned research and development activities. 

### Digital and data management

We will seek the consent of contributors to make outputs available with a CC-BY licence. The project will produce low risk Open Access digital outputs online, and they will be stored on the project's CovUni hosted WordPress website: experimental documentation practices [O1]; audio versions of exhibition materials (for visually impaired audiences) and selected visual materials from exhibitions [O3,O4]; epistemic lexicon [O6], and blog [O11]. Video content produced for the project will be stored securely, uploaded to C-DaRE's Vimeo account, and embedded in the project website: Zoom recordings of curated talks [O10]; media generated during practice-research fieldwork [O1]; and desktop documentary [O7]. The Discourse Forum [O9] software is open-source and will be hosted and managed by CovUni. The podcast [O8] will be hosted off-site at Libsyn, but individual episodes will be embedded in the project website and available freely through Apple Podcasts and Spotify. See Data Management Plan attachment (Ellis_DMP.docx).

## Outputs, Dissemination and Impact

### Beneficiaries and impacts: Who might benefit and how?

Details of _Academic Beneficiaries_ and impacts are presented in Academic Beneficiaries section of the Je-S form. _Non-academic Beneficiaries_ will be:

- **Dance and somatic artists** will benefit from new research-informed outcomes that intersect with the professional arts community [O1,O3,O4,O7]. The outcomes will impact these people as sources of inspiration for how they understand, create and share their own work.
- **Professional artists considering entering the academy** will benefit from access to a public forum of artist-scholars and potential peers. Potential impacts include insights into the pros and cons of starting a practice-research higher degree, learning how research programmes interact with professional artistic practice, and inspiration for research ideas [O9,O10]
- The curated exhibitions [O3,O4] will have two types of beneficiaries: i) **artists and members of the public** identified by the PI and project partners to contribute to and participate in the development of the outcomes, and ii) **public audiences** connected to project partners who will witness the exhibitions. Potential impacts will be to inspire users and beneficiaries, to help them develop new skills of reflection, creativity and collaboration, and as sources for learning and enjoyment about the body as a source of understanding and knowledge [O3,O4,O8]
- The podcast [O8] will be promoted to the **wider public**. The goal will be to extend the impact of the research beyond its niche epistemic concerns -- to extrapolate from the body as a site of knowledge to inform, inspire and develop new understandings for the public.

Academic and non-academic beneficiaries will be identified at the start through CovUni's research networks, the project team's personal and cross-disciplinary professional networks, project partner communities, and in-place social networks (including personal communications, regular social media and currently existing list-servs). The project builds on the needs of a large cross-section of emerging academics grappling with what it means to be an artist in the academy, the methodological possibilities of practice-research, and what claims to knowledge are plausible through these methods. It will engage these artist-scholars and their scholarly communities through diverse and distinctive outputs. For example, the Discourse Forum [O9] will be an emergent space for conversation and sharing between artists and scholars that will grow primarily through word-of-mouth. It will act as a service to the practice-research community but also as a bottom-up method to identify and communicate with project beneficiaries throughout the length of the project (and beyond), and to assess research impacts. 

The PI will work closely with the project partners to identify possible end-users and beneficiaries, and to develop and execute public engagement and evaluation strategies. For example, [O3] and [O4] are artistic-research processes developed with artists and audiences identified by the partners. The collaborations with project partners are bespoke ways of building relationships over time, engaging their audiences, and evaluating the impact of the outputs. Such bottom-up strategies towards achieving impact -- developed with beneficiaries over extended periods of time -- are fundamental to the project's sense of collaborative discovery. 

### Dissemination, public engagement and exploitation

The project's public profile will be supported by C-DaRE and CovUni communications and marketing, and social media and communication systems belonging to the project partners.  

Many of the outputs have community building and public engagement features built in [O3,O4,O8,O9,O10]. These communities will be brought together both online and through working closely with project partners to develop emergent methods to share, discuss and create conversations about the project outputs and how people are impacted by the research. The ongoing engagement with users and beneficiaries in these outputs will provide wide scope for evaluating the research and assessing the type, quality and importance of research impacts. These evaluations will include basic statistical data (numbers, demographics) and recorded conversations and written reflections. More ephemeral engagements, e.g. with audience members, will be evaluated through follow-up interviews. The goal is to gather rich impact data that reflect the experiences of the users and beneficiaries.

The processes, outcomes and outputs of _Finger Pointing Moon_ will be meticulously documented via the project website to maximise transparency and open accessibility to audiences. Audiences will be reached through social media, CovUni's marketing team, and the extended networks of project partners. All original data from the practice-research fieldwork will be openly accessible to other researchers and the wider public. The pre-press versions of articles accepted by journals behind paywalls [O2,O5] will be made available on the project website. All draft and completed text materials from all stages of the project (including the development of this fellowship proposal) will be openly accessible through a GitHub repository.{17} This OA strategy ensures research transparency and the availability of the ideas, data and outputs for other researchers to transform and publish in accordance with a Creative Commons CC-BY license. The PI has a deliberate practice of using plain language and this practice will underpin the project's communication, public engagement and dissemination strategy.
