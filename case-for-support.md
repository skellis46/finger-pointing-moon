# Finger pointing moon: recognising change through practice-research 

(Case for Support for an _AHRC Research, Development and Engagement Fellowship_ proposal)

>... they see that language is only a finger pointing at the moon and not the moon itself.[@johnston_cloud_2012 p.2]

>Some aspects of the world may be within the limits of our thought but beyond the limits of our knowledge; faced with competing descriptions of them, we cannot know which description is true. Some aspects of the world may even be beyond the limits of our thought, so that we cannot form intelligible descriptions of them, let alone know that a particular description is true.[@markie_rationalism_2017 n.p.]

## The Research Problem and Questions

Practice-research has two fundamental epistemic questions: 1) What is known or understood differently as a consequence of employing practice-research methods? 2) How might these understandings be shared and articulated? The second question has been examined in detail through research into documentation and archives.[^doc] However, the first question has been controversial and under-examined for nearly 30 years. The aim of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is to tackle this first fundamental epistemic question. 

[^doc]: e.g. Heathfield et al. [-@heathfield_shattered_1997]; Lycouris [@lycouris_documentation_2000]; and Performance Research: _On Archives & Archiving_ (2002, v20:6), _On An/Notations_ (2015, v7:4), _On Disappearance_ (2019, v24:7); See also _Journal of Artistic Research_ and _Choreographic Practices_. 

I propose three epistemic axioms[e.g. @biggs_eight_2008 p.8] to underpin the project's aim and to provide a conceptual structure for the research design: i) _limits_; in which artist-scholars fail to examine the limits of what can and cannot be known through practice-research;[ref??] ii) _proxies_; in which genuine research findings are kept at arm's length by concepts, practices or conventions. For example, documentation in practice-research often acts as a proxy for empirical evidence;[Kershaw, in @nelson_practice_2013 p.6] and iii) _hyper-specificity_; in which practice-research methods and findings are specific to single projects and rarely form part of critical dialogues in the artistic-scholarly community.[ref??] 

_Finger Pointing Moon_ has three research questions based on these axioms:

1. _Limits:_ What are the epistemic limits of practice-research? What aspects of practices are not able to be known, understood or articulated? 

2. _Proxies_: What are practice-research's common epistemic proxies and how do they affect the value of practice-research as an approach for developing new insights? 

3. _Hyper-specificity_: What language is used to express approaches, findings and failures in practice-research? How can this language be adapted in order to create increased critical dialogue between practice-research artist-scholars?

## Research context 

### Why is it important that the research questions are explored?

Practice-research is not a singular method but rather an overarching approach for working with creative practices in scholarly contexts. The approach has four key characteristics: i) it is first-person, and involves self-critical reflection, comparable to _mesearch_;[@rees_self-reflective_2019] ii) it involves repetition through artistic practice;[@blythe_framework_2016] iii) it has a contested relationship to language and dissemination; and iv) it involves experiences that are ambiguous and/or hidden. These characteristics produce "fuzzy"[@borgdorff_conflict_2012 p.181] epistemic possibilities. Consequently, artist-scholars have an open secret: we often conceive our research findings _a priori_ and/or present them _a posteriori_ as reflective spaces[@jeremy_bubb_missing_2020] using vague and hopeful language.[^3examples]

[^3examples]: Here are three arbitrary examples from the Journal of Artistic Research (2020 Vol 20, emphasis added): "_hopefully_ as you continue to read and listen, _it will become gradually clearer_" -- Miller; "the open-endedness of artistic research _allows the possibility_ for the ongoing development of _new insights_ among the wider community of creative practitioners" -- Hunt; and "with this text Iâ€™m really _not trying to make any grand statements_. It is a _collection_ of words and decisions that function more as a _demonstration_" -- Norman.

The four characteristics outlined above are uniquely amplified for artist-scholars working with body-based practices. By _body-based_ I mean practices like choreography and somatics predicated on the movements, gestures, postures and stillnesses of bodies, and where those same bodies underpin the development of new understandings. What is unique for body-based practices in relation to the key characteristics of practice-research described above is that: they have a particularly complex and often fraught relationship with language;[@bauer_no_2019] the experiential nuances are not seen, but _felt_;[@ellis_corporeal_2020] the practices intersect with contested issues of embodiment and tacit awareness;[@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011; @kampe_body-soma-self_2019] and they further complicate problems to do with disappearance, ephemerality and documentation.[@ellis_indelible_2005; @ledger_question_2011] 

The conception, context and research design of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is therefore founded on two propositions: i) that there is systemic failure in practice-research to apprehend the changes resulting from research-focused artistic practices; ii) body-based practices provide a clear and provocative methodological lens through which to investigate the epistemic complexity of practice-research.

The three research questions form the spine of the project's focus for practice-research to adopt a more lucid and evidence-based (empirical) relationship with its own epistemic possibilities, limitations and failings. The alternative to not addressing these questions is the status quo in which endless variations of process are circulated and fetishized,[@nelson_practice_2013] representational proxies are assumed to stand in for "epistemic things",[this is a term from @rheinberger_toward_1997; see also @borgdorff_conflict_2012 p.232] outcomes are rarely explicitly made in dialogue with other overlapping practices,[^theory] and there are no limits to unfalsifiable claims to understanding and no limits to the vagueness of these claims. 

[^theory]: Practice-research has a history of referring to theory, not to oppose, confront or build theoretical understandings, but to prop up the academic status of the artistic work. **Citation?** 

If _all_ practice-research is presentable as _truth_ -- even in the sense that "truth is aspirational"[@ingold_search_2018 n.p.] -- then it is broken as an approach to creating new understandings. 

### Other research in this area

In 1992 the UK Higher Education Funding Councils first recognised the work of artists as research and, given the potential "access to highly lucrative government funding",[@magee_introduction._2012 n.p.] art and artists became invested in the production of knowledge. Since then, the epistemological project in practice-research has comprised various attempts to reverse-engineer art-making through an epistemological lens. That is, once art was recognised as research it became necessary to justify and validate its knowledge-producing bona fides, and to avoid a situation in which "the entire history of art [became] eligible for a postgraduate research degree."[@frayling_research_1993 p.5] 

#### The intrinsic-extrinsic debate

The project of creating epistemic justifications for practice-research has been characterised by a continuum bookended by two conflicting positions:[^40k] 1) artistic artefacts require a written statement that synthesises the epistemic status (findings) of the research;[e.g. @noauthor_ref2021_2019; @nelson_practice_2013] 2) artistic artefacts themselves contain and communicate research findings.[e.g. @borgdorff_conflict_2012] 

[^40k]: For example, note the contradiction in the UK that a practice-research PhD normally requires approximately 40k words of contextual writing, while a submission to the Research Excellence Framework only requires a 300 word summary statement. 

Both positions have inherent problems. The extrinsic position -- that knowledge in practice-research is only revealed or clarified through written contextualisation[@bolt_magic_2007; @smith_practice-led_2009; @candy_role_2011] -- limits the importance of the artefact,[@magee_introduction._2012; @borgdorff_debate_2006; @candlin_proper_2000] and sets no margins on the epistemic claims that artistic-scholars make on behalf of their practices. Such claims are rarely "made available for sustained and verifiable peer review".[@haseman_tightrope_2007 n.p.; see also @candy_role_2011] 

The intrinsic position -- that knowledge is intrinsic to or "embodied in"[@borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.vi] artistic-research artefacts[@ellis_that_2018; @borgdorff_conflict_2012] -- positions ambiguity and uncertainty as epistemic virtues that produce "less identifiable knowledge products."[@butt_performance_2014 p.114]. Such products act as points of epistemic resistance: they "resist academic conventions of accountability"[@borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.ix] or "ways of knowing that are not able to shape -- or be shaped by -- the various tools and systems of the knowledge economy."[@ellis_that_2018 p.490]  

The tension between intrinsic and extrinsic _claims to knowledge_ in practice-research looms over all practical and theoretical work in the field.[e.g. @borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.ix] It is a conflict founded on: i) the extent to which scholars and regulatory bodies _believe_ that language is needed to describe and justify claims to knowledge;[e.g. @berry_life_2001; @williams_mindfulness_2012] ii) differing perspectives on the limits of artistic practice outcomes to _hold_ and communicate understanding;[e.g. @stephen_scrivener_art_2002; @borgdorff_debate_2006] and iii) the contested relationship between artistic-scholarly outcomes and the pursuit of truth.[e.g. @nelson_practice_2013; @noe_strange_2015; @ingold_search_2018] 

In _Finger Pointing Moon_ the intrinsic-extrinsic conflict likewise looms over the project's methods, analysis and outcomes. The conflict is the historical epistemic air that the project will breathe. 

#### Past efforts to describe an epistemology of practice-research

Pakes suggests that it is easy to make the claim for a "distinctive kind of knowledge" emerging from practice-research, but far more difficult to specify the make up of such knowledge.[-@pakes_art_2004 n.p.]

##### Know-how and technÃª

One early attempt to solve the epistemic problem in practice-research was to invoke the concepts of practical knowledge (_technÃª_) and know-how as a way of understanding artistic-research specific epistemics.[^techne] This work has three problems: 1) It has rarely made it clear where understanding or knowledge is _located:_ in the work of art or with the researcher. 2) It has failed to distinguish know-how in practice-research from the kind of know-how present in any research discipline. That is, what is peculiar to the concept of know-how in artistic practice-research as compared with, for example, engineering or bioethics?[@johnson_embodied_2011] 3) It does not explicitly address _change_ as a consequence of research processes -- in any research process the question of what we understand or know differently as a consequence of that process is fundamental.[@johnson_embodied_2011; @ellis_that_2018] 

[^techne]: This draws on the work of Aristotle, Ryle, Carr and Polanyi, and more recently Pakes. See Borgdorff for an overview[-@borgdorff_debate_2006]

##### The role of the artefact

Scrivener wrote that the "art object does not embody a form of knowledge."[@stephen_scrivener_art_2002 n.p.] Yet Borgdorff suggests that knowledge is "embodied in art practices (objects, processes)."[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.13] Even in disagreement, both scholars focus on the limits of the artefact in practice-research. In so doing they draw the art object's audience into the issue -- Borgdorff through his focus on hermeneutics, and Scrivener through his argument that artworks (or artefacts) require interpretation, and as such can be called _apprehensions_ or "objects which must be grasped by the senses and the intellect" which when grasped offer "ways of seeing and being".[@stephen_scrivener_art_2002 n.p.]  

##### Audiences

Other work has built on Scrivener's recognition that the audience is fundamental to the epistemic project of practice-research.[e.g. Magee -@magee_introduction._2012; Ellis -@ellis_that_2018] Rather than producing knowledge itself, the artist produces "a compelling, mesmerising question"[@magee_introduction._2012 p.5] and the artefact affords possibilities for understanding in those who experience it. This is a radically "expanded epistemology"[@ellis_that_2018 p.488] in which practice-research is "dependent on its audience to do its epistemic work."[@ellis_that_2018 p.488]  

**NoÃ« writes that in art and philosophy "there arenâ€™t breakthroughs or discoveries or results or findings in these fields, certainly not ones that invalidate or cancel out earlier ones or preclude future ones."[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 11, n.p.] Rather, what we have is more about change, history and evolution; "moves in an important conversation"[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 11, n.p.] that keep that conversation alive and open. Art and philosophy do not produce "stand-alone nuggets of truth"[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 11, n.p.] but are akin to a score which we enact as much as we perceive:**

>We start out not seeing what is there. But by looking and interrogating and challenging, we come to see it. The work challenges us to reorganize our seeing, our expectations, and our thinking. The work of art, like that of philosophy, is the reorganization of ourselves. And this reorganization, this work, aims also at understanding.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 11, n.p.]

**NoÃ« is stating that the value and function of art is not about discovery, but in understanding. We are changed by it.** -- and therefore, the communication of changes becomes vital to the epistemological project in any research, but particularly PaR and in particular (even more) body-based.

**The question becomes then who is changed by it -- and sets up the possibility of [[a case for writing in practice-research]] in which the artist-researcher sometimes does that work of change, other times allows it to rest with the audience/viewer. In this respect it's not so much the presence of writing that confers the status of 'research' on a work of art, but rather that the researcher has done the work of communicating change/understanding (which will not be equivalent to the understandings afforded by the artistic artefact)**

Past efforts to describe an epistemology of practice-research reveal the complexity of the problem. There are effectively three _agents_ at play in this intellectual labour -- the artefact, the artist and the audience -- and the extent to which an artist-scholar foregrounds the role of each has determined their position in understanding the epistemic boundaries of practice-research. What is shared between the positions is an overarching relativist constructivist framework. Such a framework gives license to the artist-scholar (and/or the audience) to say anything about the work they present and represent; that is, there are no limits to the claims that are made. 

### My contribution to improving, enhancing, or developing creativity, insights, knowledge or understanding in the area

>Some aspects of the world may be within the limits of our thought but beyond the limits of our knowledge; faced with competing descriptions of them, we cannot know which description is true. Some aspects of the world may even be beyond the limits of our thought, so that we cannot form intelligible descriptions of them, let alone know that a particular description is true.[@markie_rationalism_2017 n.p.]

- empirical: I am not proposing evidence evidence evidence. Tension between evidence, and allowing the creative work to do its work.
- proxy is very different from staring into the belly of not knowing. Accepting the possibility of not knowing or there are things that are not able to be known (use Markie above)
- draw together large range of ideas, opinions and histories that have attempted to handle the epistemology of practice-research
- where the large body of work has used (often by default) a relativist approach to making epistemic claims, my ambition is to incorporate rationalism, and empiricism
- to speak directly to the problems -- push through the fuzziness
- creating language for this empirical approach

- to address the idea that practice-research's place is an epistemic place (and not to stay within realm of techne). to know something differently. to know-that. this is not to reduce or displace know-how or craft. ties to Rheinberger and building epistemic things.
- but what is the nature of this epistemic place? can something that is unknowable (akin to Berry's thinking) except through direct experience (ref from obsidian) be an epistemic thing? And if not, what kind of _thing_ is it? 
- some kind of line between what is observable and standpoint epistemology

interested not only in what we can agree on but what we can clearly disagree about on. what can't be said? some things must be open to debate (other than just methodology). Where is there legitimate disagreement? (heterotopic discourse -- ways of arguing) -- similar to Biggs and Buchler (2011) approach, p.83 of the chapter in their edited volume.

### Who will be most interested in the outcomes? 

The research will be most interesting to artist-scholars from across disciplines who are working in and through practice-research. This includes graduate and postgraduate students who are grappling with how and why their work is important and to whom. The work will also be valuable to philosophers of epistemology who are researching epistemic edge-cases to do with know-how and testimony. Aspects of the research will also be interesting to body-based research specialists who grapple with understanding the epistemic potential of their work, and particularly in relation to contested ideas of embodied and tacit knowledge. 

- add "large range of emerging and established scholars working with practice-research methodologies"
- add how development components are designed to enhance the scope and reach of the ideas

### Research objectives

The aim of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is to address practice-research's fundamental epistemic question: _What can we know or understand differently as a consequence of practice-research?_ There are three research questions -- _Limits_, _Proxies_ and _Hyper-specificity_ -- with corresponding objectives as follows. 

_1. Limits: What are the epistemic limits of practice-research? What aspects of practices are not able to be known, understood or articulated?_

1. identify qualities of experience from first-person body-based practice experiments that resist being known, are deeply uncertain, or are unable to be articulated
2. identify qualities of experience from first-person body-based practice experiments that assist being known, display some quality of certainty, or are able to be articulated **add third-person here**

_2. Proxies: What are practice-research's common epistemic proxies and how do they affect the value of practice-research as an approach for developing new insights?_ 

3. in-depth survey of practice-research epistemology literature from the early 1990s (when practice-research began in the academy) to the present (building on unpublished work of Ken Friedman)
4. identify and critique any epistemic ambiguities/limitations/possibilities in this scholarship
5. identify epistemic proxies of practice-research -- these are the ways in which practice-research represents its understandings or findings while keeping them at arm's length
6. critical analysis of the affects of epistemic proxies on epistemic clarity and specificity in practice-research  

_3. Hyper-specificity: What language is used to express approaches, findings and failures in practice-research? How can this language be adapted in order to create increased critical dialogue between practice-research artist-scholars?_

7. collect and analyse language used by artist-scholars to describe their research findings, understandings, failures and ambiguities. 
8. modify and adapt this language in order to find ways of linking the epistemic status of previously distinct research projects
9. categorise and organise these qualities of experience into a lexicon of epistemic _findings and failures_ in practice-research


## Research methods 

### Which research methods?

The research methods described below are designed to realise the project objectives. The objectives, in turn, respond directly to the three wide-angle research problems -- _limits_, _proxies_ and _hyper-specificity_ -- which underpin the project's aim to address practice-research's fundamental epistemic question: What is known or understood differently as a consequence of practice-research methods? The following research methods are organised under the three overarching problems they address. 

**Is the practice in AHRC contributing to that discourse (around the body/AM/etc) or solely in service of PaR?** See for example <art practice and artistic research.md> in slip box. I have a feeling the AM is serving two masters. More importantly, what do I want it to do? Frayling's in, for and through useful here? 

1. _Limits:_ 

- **Empirical and experiential practice-research fieldwork**: 4 x 2 week blocks (20 hours per week) of Authentic Movement (body-based practice)  
- **Experimental documentation** developed through critical reflection and writing, and still and moving images
- **Empirical and sensorial analysis** through first and third-person observation of the practice to propose epistemic limits 
- **Scholarly writing**: first and third-person case report to communicate findings 

2. _Proxies_:

- **Literature and field research and review** of practice-research scholarship and practice to identify any epistemic patterns, ambiguities and proxies
- **Critical analysis** of these materials to develop a theoretical argument regarding the use of epistemic proxies in practice-research 
- **Scholarly writing** to further understand and then communicate findings

3. _Hyper-specificity_: 

- **Systematic review and meta-analysis** of practice-research field to understand language used to express approaches, findings and failures
- **Critical analysis** of this language to design, propose and share a lexicon of epistemic findings and failures in practice-research

### Why these methods?

>Why have you chosen these methods? Why are they the best way to answer the research questions or problems you have identified? 

>Depending on the approach you are using throughout your research, you may also need to explain clearly the creative and/or performative aspects of the work, explain how you will develop a new process, product or tool, or provide details of who you have consulted or will be involved in the process of research.

The methods above contain reflection, empirical and critical analysis, writing, creative practice and documentation. They are designed to address the research questions from the inside through experimental practice-research, and the outside through more traditional scholarship. 

#### Experimental practice-research

The methodological heart of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is to use Authentic Movement (AM) as the basis for experimental practice-research fieldwork.

Authentic Movement is a process-oriented movement practice that specifically distinguishes the body as observed from the outside (third-person perspective) and the soma as perceived from the inside (first-person perception).[@hanna_what_1995 p.341] AM provides a structured body-based process of empirical (visible) and sensorial (non-visible) observation. Its focus is on _doing something_ rather than _making something_, and the practice dwells deeply in ambiguous feelings and thoughts, presents movement experiences that are not obviously visible and thereby complicated to document, and has an ambivalent relationship to the written word. Therefore, AM is an edge-case / paradigmatic way to examine the epistemic limits, possibilities and failings of body-based practice-research, and to propose extrapolations of these limits to other practice-research disciplines. The practice offers clear and precise limits necessary to wrestle with these fundamental questions of what can be known differently ...

"Unconditional positive regard"[@rogers_necessary_1957]

>As Schwab thinks through the relationship between artistic research and contemporary art he proposes that we must move away from objects (not clear what he means by objects) with a "more or less stable historical identity"[@schwab_experimental_2019 p.166] to "more precarious, ambivalent, or provisional things."[@schwab_experimental_2019 p.166] -- support for use of AM?


- AM as a primary or contemplative experience of reality. See <contemplation beyond rationalization.md> -- and the really real
- distinction between soma and body: <first-person experience.md>
- Varela's term "sustained examination" -- as method

In _Finger Pointing Moon_ the practice will involve three people. The first two (Ellis and Whalley) will work with an experimental form of the AM practice oscillating between the roles of _mover_ and _observer_. Over the course of the practice they will adapt it (including using first, second and third-person photography and videography)[e.g. @bedard_disembodied_2015] by experimenting with the limits and possibilities of observable and sensorial experience.[This method builds on earlier work by Ellis, e.g. -@ellis_corporeal_2020] The third collaborator (TBC) will act as an external observer to the entire practice. The three roles provide degrees of proximity to the empirical and non-empirical qualities of the practice-research.

The practice will be documented from _within_ via photography, videography, written and spoken reflections, and from _without_ via TBC's detailed third-person observations and analysis.    


- add Varelaâ€™s thinking about first person experience (in zettel <first-person experience>) â€” see question and thoughts in there?
- check that I am clear that the design is only part PaR. See zettel <art practice and artistic research.md> -- also, only part is really what Bob and I will do (including outcomes). That PaR is then applied ... (check through, with and in)

add something from Bob here about limited knowledges?

Skills as an artist-scholar ...
The â€˜job in handâ€™ gives a further and complex insight into enquiries of bodies, and what lies in between / beneath / behind. The artist scholar is charged with the doing, (un)doing, of something. Some of the skills pertinent to the task ...
Ways of reading
Ways of understanding 
Ways of bodies
Temporary understandings
Understandings in flux
Embedded / entwined and limited knowledges. 

This â€˜limitedâ€™ nature is an area of perhaps enhancement to artistic-scholarly practice (in yours, and others). Not in terms of filling the gaps, or as presaged understanding, but of what can be forgotten. So a different route to delimiting knowledge.

#### Traditional scholarship




### People and roles

>What will be your role? If there are other people involved, what will their roles be and why are they the appropriate people to be involved? 

PI:  
RA:  
XX: expert input  
Bob Whalley: expert input  


### Copyright or intellectual property issues

>Under the Research Methods heading you should also outline how any copyright or intellectual property issues relating to the project and the production of any outputs will be addressed.

- ask CW about this

## Development plan 

>This section of the Case for Support should include details of your proposed development activities, and an explanation as to why these activities are appropriate to helping you enhance capabilities as research specialists in your field. You should make clear how these activities enhance the transformational potential of the research and its broader influence and importance. Please refer to the Enhancing Research Capabilities in section 1.5 for further details on what is requirement for this section.(p.73)

>In framing your proposal, you will need to clearly articulate a set of activities and to demonstrate both how they will enhance your role within your field, and how they significantly develop your research and its broader influence and importance.(p.26)

>The activities outlined, which should be commensurate with your current career stage and trajectory, should go beyond the kinds of activities that researchers generally undertake in establishing themselves in their disciplines or in the ordinary course of their duties. In other words, the Fellowship offers the opportunity to be innovative in the types of activity which might be taken forward and allows Fellows to explore new avenues. Fellowship proposals should include a substantial programme of collaborative activities and you should be bold in thinking about what is needed to support them.

>When applying to this scheme, fellows will be required to articulate a set of development activities, to demonstrate how they will enhance their profile or status within their field, and how they will develop their research and its broader influence and importance.(p.101 Guide 4.9)

>-to develop capabilities as research specialists and to create opportunities for outreach beyond their research field;
>-to undertake innovative and collaborative development activities, including the initiation of new research, which will result in benefits for their own discipline(s) and beyond.

>How are these all researcher-development activities?

I have been an artist for 30 years, and an artist in the academy for 20 years. In this time, I have pursued and developed individual research practices that have led to small-scale and intimate outcomes. It would seem that my attention -- and perhaps ambition -- has been mostly inward or personal. -- **note Hetty's response. Change to it being more that I've resisted expansive wider public dissemination?**

In order for practice-research to be more widely acknowledged beyond its own disciplinary fields, it is "necessary to consider and adhere to the demands of the larger academic community".[@biggs_eight_2008 p.15] The research component of _Finger Pointing Moon_ seeks to develop a new line of epistemic inquiry in practice-research by employing an experimental shift towards empiricism by which to test the limitations of findings and claims in practice-research. The project's development plan builds on the research component of this proposal, and uses this new line of inquiry as a means to radically change my previous focus on personal creative practice by developing a series of outward-facing activities that will test and improve my communication and advocacy skills beyond and within the academy.

The development plan will enhance my role within practice-research, and significantly develop the influence and importance of my research by helping me acquire four new capabilities: 1) to communicate and contextualise niche and complex ideas about fundamental epistemics of practice-research beyond the practice-research field and also to the wider public; 2) to demonstrate leadership in methodological advances in practice-research; 3) to develop and support a broad cross-disciplinary community of active artist-scholars; and 4) to create a range of collaborative opportunities with academic and non-academic stake-holders within and and outside of dance and the performing arts. 

These four capabilities will be developed through four bold and innovative activities:

_1. Unforgettable_

This will be an exhibition of materials based on a practice of gathering and sharing the community's experiences of dance and movement. Artists, scholars and audiences from around the world will send a written note or letter that describes a single unforgettable moment or experience of dance or dancing. These documents will be collated and organised into an exhibition to be presented by project partners at various spaces around the world. _Unforgettable_ builds on the research's epistemic narrative by exploring the role of memory and languages of experience and expression in understanding how we come to know what we know. The process and exhibition is designed to: i) inspire creativity in how other researchers understand and represent the scope of their largely theoretical undertakings; ii) seek wider impact by ambitiously engaging a global cross-section of participants; iii) develop new research-informed partnerships and collaborations with non-academic organisations around the world.

_2. The Un/knowable Body_

_The Un/knowable Body_ will involve collecting a large quantity of cross- and inter-disciplinary materials that reveal the limits, margins and possibilities of human understanding and experience of the body. These materials will be gathered by the PI and RA but will then be sent to [xx] project partners in Australia, UK, Italy ... [etc]. Each project partner will work with their local communities -- in consultation with the PI -- to explore ways to organise, curate, present and respond to the materials and then develop a bespoke programme of events that explore knowledges of the body. _The Un/knowable Body_ directly explores a key part of the research component of _Finger Pointing Moon_ by addressing what is able to be known -- and what remains unknown -- about visual and sensorial experiences of the human body. The activity will: i) foster interdisciplinary research by working with and presenting materials from a broad disciplinary range; ii) inspire creativity in other researchers by creating models for public engagement that emerge from those publics (rather than top-down or researcher focused models); iii) create wider impact for the research aspects of the project by building relationships between highly theoretical (and niche) ideas to do with epistemology, with accessible and meaningful materials for the wider public; iv) create new research partnerships and collaborations between the PI and project partners working across disciplinary fields.

_3. Artistic Research forum_

This activity is to create and support a broad cross-disciplinary community of scholars and artists working either directly or indirectly with practice-research. It will involve initiating an online Discourse Forum[^disc] -- called _Artistic Research Forum_ -- that will modernise old-style email-based list-servs like PARIP and SCUDD, and act as a large-scale _conversation_ on historical, current and future thinking, practices and understandings of practice-research. Discourse forums are easily divided into different conversations, examples might be: artistic research history; epistemology; documentation; key texts; ongoing practices; FAQs; etc. The forum will be sustained by a large and diverse group of experienced and emerging artist-scholars volunteering from around the world; it will, in effect, be a collaboration across the entire practice-research community. This is an ambitious activity that will: i) enable the PI to provide intellectual leadership through an openly accessible network of artist-scholars; ii) inspire creativity and development in other researchers both through materials posted to the forum and through its open and collaborative form; iii) help shape research agendas in which the forum acts like a town-square environment where vital conversations are easily heard and contributed to; and iv) encourage new research collaborations and partnerships as contributors engage with the materials and ideas presented in the forum.

_4. The Point Beyond_

The Point Beyond will be a podcast that explores the limits of what it is to be human. It will initially be limited to two series of eight episodes, and each episode will be a conversation with an expert that explores the point beyond which our understanding and experience falters. The two series will be i) _limits of knowledge_ (e.g. experimental failures; perception and perceptual error; contemplation, meditation and enlightenment; truth and belief; conspiracy; machine learning and AI); ii) _limits of language_ (e.g. when words fail us; swearing and cussing; language vs direct experience; silence and contemplation; mutism; computer languages and coding). Other series (after the fellowship) could potentially be: limits of language; cultural limits (the overton window); psychological limits; moral limits; imagined limits. _The Point Beyond_ is a direct attempt to take the research heart of _Finger Pointing Moon_ -- the limits and possibilities of human understanding -- and extrapolate that work deep into other areas, ideas and practices. It will: i) inspire creativity and development in other researchers by building broad cross-disciplinary and wider-public interest in ideas that matter to how we understand being human; ii) directly foster inter- and cross-disciplinary research involving artistic research and dance by building lively and focused conversations with other experts; iii) challenge the PI's ability to communicate complex ideas to a broad audience; iv) focus on clearly and directly on public engagement: why do these niche and largely theoretical ideas matter and to whom? 

## Project management 

>How will the project be managed? What will be the roles of the members of staff involved (including you and, if applicable, any research assistants)? What is the timetable for the project? Does it include appropriate milestones and is it realistic? When will the outputs of the project be completed? How will you ensure that they meet the needs of your audience? Can the 
costs be justified? How will you ensure good value for money? 
The project management section should also include the management of the digital and data management aspects of the projects, if applicable, and should be coordinated with the information in the Data Management Plan. It should be clear what the milestones for the completion of this element and the work should be incorporated into the timetable for the whole project. The project management of the data management aspects of the project should include an assessment of risk in relation to the complexity and delivery of the project.
If a postdoctoral researcher is to be employed, you should state clearly the nature of the work they will be undertaking and describe clearly the working relationships that are envisaged between all the 
members of the research team. You should describe fully the arrangements for supervising and managing the research assistant. If the researcher is unknown you should state the skills and qualifications sought. Similarly, if the project involves a visit to or a secondment from a member of staff from another organisation, you must state clearly what work they will pursue and describe the 
working relationships envisaged with other members of the team.
In terms of supporting the research staff funded on the project, you should clearly outline the development opportunities which the project will make available. These should include opportunities both in relation to research expertise, and wider opportunities, for example, in connection with the activities proposed in the Pathways to Impact statement.

>The AHRC is one of the signatories of the RCUK Concordat to Support the Career Development of 
Researchers. More information about the Concordat and what it entails can be found here: [ukri.org/files/legacy/skills/review-tor-concordat/](https://www.ukri.org/files/legacy/skills/review-tor-concordat/)

The following are examples of possible ways of formulating a proposal; they are for illustrative purposes only:
â€¢ You could request 6-12 months at 100% time with researcher development activities integrated for the duration of the funded time.
â€¢ You could request funding for 12 months for concentrated research activities at 100% FTE, followed by 6 months at 20% time to conduct researcher development activities building on this research.
â€¢ You could request 6 months at 100% time for skillset activities followed by 12 months at 40% time continuing the research alongside researcher development activities.(p.28 Funding Guide)

- RA: website maintenance, and annotated bibliography of literature and practice (shared zotero library), published online as ongoing page on project website (with links to OA versions of originals where possible). edited collections (books) to be annotated by chapters. Or single page as database that includes one/two line summary of the publication/research. are we creating a database here? 
- 

- split between research activities (outputs) and developmental ones, and the possibility of managing this throughout the 18 months

- balance of research and development activities throughout the 18 months. recognising that they go hand in hand. ??

>Your Fellowship project can be up to 18 months (min at 0.5FTE max at 1.0FTE) but the research assistance can be up to a total 12 months of full time distributed over the 18-month period.
In other words, RA can work up to the maximum at (12/18) FTE for 18 months or 1.0 FTE for 12 months. 
See page 20, section Research Assistance. (from Amy)

## Outputs, Dissemination and Impact

>The Outputs, Dissemination and Impact section is your opportunity to describe in more detail how the potential impacts of the research will be realised. Information under this heading should build on details given in the Summary and Academic Beneficiaries sections of the Je-S form whilst also elaborating further on other areas of the Case for Support. You should address two main questions: who might benefit from the research and how might they benefit?

>Taking into account what is reasonable and appropriate given the nature of the research you propose to conduct, please provide examples of how the proposed research will be managed to engage any users and beneficiaries that have been identified, or to identify potential users and beneficiaries as the research progresses, and to increase the likelihood of achieving impacts. In presenting your plans, you should tailor and target your dissemination activities to ensure that they are relevant to the specific user and beneficiary groups likely to be interested in your research and appropriate for supporting the potential research impacts outlined.

>You should consider (and address if appropriate) methods for communications and engagement, collaboration and development. You should also detail who will be undertaking any dissemination activities and include any resource implications in the financial summary and in the separate Justification of Resources attachment. Please also explain further how the research will benefit other researchers in the field and â€“ where relevant â€“ academic beneficiaries in other disciplines.

>It is your responsibility to justify the value and appropriateness of the output(s) and outcomes in the Case for Support.

_assessment criteria (from assessment-criteria.md):_

>â€¢ the appropriateness and effectiveness of the proposed dissemination methods
â€¢ the extent to which the research process is documented or recorded in a way to enable dissemination of research outcomes to the widest possible audience
â€¢ the likelihood that the outputs and outcomes of the project will be highly valued and widely exploited, both in the research community and in wider contexts where they can make a difference
â€¢ whether the plans to increase impact are appropriate and justified, given the nature of the proposed research
â€¢ whether sufficient attention has been given to who the beneficiaries of the research might be and appropriate ways to engage with them throughout the project.


>You are encouraged to disseminate your research and its outcomes to as wide an audience as possible, and where appropriate to engage in communication, dissemination and exploitation activities throughout the period of the project. You should therefore specify the audiences to whom your research could be of interest, and how you propose to engage with those audiences about your research.

>You should address two main questions: who might benefit from the research and how might they benefit?

_Finger Pointing Moon_ is driven by research (RES) _and_ developmental (DEV) concerns, and will produce the following outputs: 

1. Authentic Movement: speculative and experimental documentation practices through writing and still and moving images; published online (RES)
2. Scholarly article about epistemic limits, written with expert input from XX (RES)
3. _Unforgettable_ exhibition (as detailed in Development Plan) (DEV)
4. _The Un/knowable Body_ exhibition (also detailed in Development Plan) (DEV)
5. Scholarly article on epistemic proxies (RES)
6. Lexicon of epistemological "findings and failures", published online
7. Video essay that collates and articulates key concerns/findings of entire research project (RES)
8. Two series of 8 episodes of podcast (DEV): Series 1: limits of knowledge; Series 2: limits of language
9. Initiate and support Discourse forum (see Development Plan) (DEV)
10. Three curated talks online (micro-conferences) that emerge from key topics on Discourse Forum site (RES)
11. Project website and blog to make the project processes and outcomes publicly accessible (RES/DEV)


1. scholars: body-based artist-researchers, somatic practitioners, researchers exploring experimental documentation practices in PaR, psychology scholars looking at judgement/non-judgement (what's that psych term I was looking into?); wider public: dance artists, artists considering photographic documentation of time-based work, somatic and authentic movement practitioners ...
2. 

what is the difference between a beneficiary and an end-user?
+ Outputs and Dissemination (what you will do with the knowledge) for your audience:
    * To Beneficiaries â€“ who are they
    * To End Users â€“ who are they?
    * What is the plan to exploit outcomes to beneficiaries and end users (short description)
    * Will there be Public Engagement?

these outputs should address (in some form) the overall aim. Can this aim allude to key aspect of communications or is that separate to the 'research'? And also the three research questions.



- key question for me here is how do non-academics benefit from this work? this is probably why that practice for theatre exhibitions is useful. It gets back to the Snowden thing.

## other things to consider

- my skills and experience (competence)
- value: is the project good value? ? (mention resources, type and quantity/level needed justified in Plan)
