# Case for Support - Finger Pointing Moon

## The Research Problem and Questions 

- detail the problem that _requires_ this research project to solve it (about 30% of CfS)
- Objectives and how they are important in solving the problem (give short list of reasons citing evidence)

>You should describe clearly the research questions, issues or problems that you intend to address. What are the issues that you will be exploring in the course of your research?

This is a research leadership project called _Finger Pointing Moon_. It addresses four fundamental epistemic problems to do with 'new knowledge' or 'new understandings' in body-based practice-research. By _body-based_ I mean artistic-scholarly practices like dance and somatics where the body underpins both the practices and the development of new understandings. Such practices are predicated on movement, gesture, posture and stillness. 

The four epistemic problems are: 1) The problem of the proxy; 2. The problem of what cannot be known; 3) The problem of what can be known; 4) The problem of generalisability.

### 1. The Problem of the Proxy

Need to ask this as a question. That is -- not something I already think/believe. Recognise that embody is a term used loosely (can draw on definitions here), but analysis of how it is used, and potentially what is not being said. This is a kind of 'meta' or high-level approach.

objectives:  
    + identity key uses and characteristics of 'embodied knowledge' in artistic-scholarly literature, focusing on dance and somatics  
    + identify and critique any ambiguities/limitations/possibilities in this scholarship

methods:  
    + traditional scholarship: literature review  
    + traditional scholarship: analysis of materials  

outcomes:  
    + glossary of terms critical to current use of 'embodied knowledge' in artistic-scholarly practices of dance and somatics 
    + annotated bibliography of key references regarding embodiment and embodied knowledge
    + critical reflection on this analysis published as scholarly journal article 

(comes to stand in for the thing, but it is not the thing)

>they see that language is only a finger pointing at the moon and not the moon itself.[@johnston_cloud_2012 p.2]

There is an epistemic crisis in body-based practice-research. It is a crisis revealed by the sharp rise in scholarship exploring the nature of embodied knowledge.[^ek] In much of that research, the idea that the body _knows_ acts as a proxy for the epistemic limitations of practice-research investigations. In other words, artist-scholars who research through movement practices are valorising and reifying the concept of embodied knowledge 

### 2 and 3. The Problem of What Can and Cannot Be Known

- problem of what can't be known: problem of unknown (and certainty unarticulated) epistemic limitations of practice-research -- what are the things that can't be known, understood or articulated?  
- (old) problem of what can be understood (or known) differently through practice-research

objectives:  
    + identify qualities of experience in body-based practice that resist being known, are deeply uncertain, or are unable to be articulated  
    + identify qualities of experience in body-based practice that assist being known, display some quality of certainty, and are able to be articulated  

methods:  
    + traditional scholarship: literature and field (practice) review of published materials that implicitly and/or explicitly examine epistemics of body-based practice    
    + practice-research: process-driven experimental movement practice
    + practice-research: collecting practice of 'unforgettable experiences'  
    + practice-research: solitude practice (speculative _wildcard_)
    + practice-research: collecting practice of epistemic materials focusing on 'what dance knows'

outcomes:  
    + 




### 4. The Problem of Generalisability

objectives:  

methods:  

outcomes:  
    + develop and publish a set of epistemic principles for body-based practice-research
    + develop and publish a set of epistemic values for body-based practice-research
    + journal article exploring these findings (values and principles)

By addressing these problems I aim to produce epistemic values and principles for body-based practice-research (but might be able to be extended beyond )

what do I mean by 'epistemic values'? e.g. transparency and rigour of who, when and why is creating knowledge

while failing to address the key epistemic paradox of creative practice-research: that its nature lies at least in part in what is _not_ able to be known, understood or articulated as a consequence of body-based creative practices.[^ttp1] This is a humbling limitation for any research method or process, and a crucial problem in the development of practice-research in the Academy.

The contemporary cultural backdrop for the tension between embodied knowledge, the unknowable, and the inarticulable is the datafication of human experience. In 2017 _The Economist_ declared that the "world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data".[^econ] We live in the age of _surveillance capitalism_ that is founded on "extractive operations in which our personal experiences are scraped and packaged as the means to others’ ends".[^zub1] The cultural and financial capital of understanding the world-as-data means it is not surprising that precarious and delicate artistic practices and processes located in and through the body – like dance and somatics – have also become enamoured by the doctrine of datafication. The rapidly growing number of online archives, digital forms of documentation, and virtual and augmented reality projects are all implicit or explicit attempts by dance scholars to transform the radically analogue nature of embodied experiences into data.[^plethora] 

is underpinned by these two phenomena: the limitations of embodied practice-research, and the datafication of experience. These phenomena are related because the construction and production of knowledge in any scholarly field is never based on the simple and objective observation of worldly phenomena. Rather, to understand what we say we know and do not know, the vital epistemic question is in fact "who, when, [and] why is constructing knowledges?"[^mig1] If the overwhelming contemporary phenomenon is the extraction of data from human experiences, then the question of _who, when and why is constructing knowledges_ necessitates an encounter with the limits and excesses of datafication. 

In this project, I propose that complex and radically analogue human experiences like experimental choreographic and movement practices have ontologies that are underpinned by two key characteristics: a) they defy the capacity to be accurately and wholly articulated and shared; and b) they exceed "algorithmic description".[^odell1] _Finger Pointing Moon_ is positioned squarely at the intersection of the datafication of human experience and the limitations of embodied practice-research. 

_Finger Pointing Moon_ is a project designed around creative practices that resist datafication, understanding and articulation, and the overarching purpose of the design is to create the conditions in which to develop an original set of practice-research epistemic principles (and also set of values). How does this aim relate to datafication? More like it's something to push against -- that it acts as a 'measure' of utility and function. That if something resists that process, it reveals things about the nature of that _something_. This makes the concept of datafication a methodological (and conceptual/theoretical?) strategy. A kind of thought experiment.   

### Project Aims 

- make the language of these match with end of previous paragraph

1. To explore the limits of embodied practice-research, situated within the broad contemporary context of the datafication of human experience.

### Objectives

- to develop an original and comprehensive set of practice-research epistemic principles
- to generate and critically examine three research practices for which their epistemic possibilities are radically different. 
- research and produce annotated bibliography of PaR literature that refers to its history and its epistemic possibilities and limits
- epistemic principles in practice-research
- epistemic values in practice-research 


## Research context 

>You should describe the research context for your project/programme of work. Why is it important that these questions or issues are explored? What other research is being or has been conducted in this area? What contribution will your project make to improving, enhancing, or developing creativity, insights, knowledge or understanding in your chosen area of study? To whom will the outcomes of your research be of particular interest?



>Have we somehow conspired to arrange matters so that knowledge is always what we say about something rather than what we show about it? [@biggs_editorial_2002]


## Research design and methods 

>What research methods will you be using to address the questions or issues that you have set yourself, or solve the problems you have identified, or to explore the matters you intend to investigate? Why have you chosen these methods? Why are they the best way to answer the research questions or problems you have identified? What will be your role? If there are other people involved, what will their roles be and why are they the appropriate people to be involved? 

>In describing your research methods it is not sufficient to state, for example, that you intend to visit a particular archive, or an exhibition abroad. You must provide adequate details of sources to be consulted, and you should state briefly what kinds of material you will be consulting, why they are relevant to your programme of research, and how you will interrogate them. Depending on the approach you are using throughout your research, you may also need to explain clearly the creative and/or performative aspects of the work, explain how you will develop a new process, product or tool, or provide details of who you have consulted or will be involved in the process of research.

>Under the Research Methods heading you should also outline how any copyright or intellectual property issues relating to the project and the production of any outputs will be addressed.

>convince decision makers that ‘this is the best solution’ and feel compelled to fund it – (approx >50% of content);

### Overview

Intro here about the nature of the design, why it's appropriate. Multi-modal. practice and The research design comprises two overlapping areas of research that underpin the project: 1) practice-research and epistemics; 2) leadership, uncertainty and humility. 

The areas overlap because of potential for leadership to be understood as a practice of epistemic humility. add something here about affecting change (Bendell). something about it being comprehensive.

#### Research Area: knowledge production, uncertainty, practice-research and epistemics

This area contains experimental practice-research fieldwork and traditional scholarly research to approach experiences and understandings of practice-research epistemics from the inside (through practice) and the outside (through scholarship).

##### + __Practice-research fieldwork__ 

consisting of three distinct practices (all based on the premise that we understand through doing (Ingold here?):

1. process-driven experimental movement practice 1st and 2nd person component.[^1st] high resolution experiences through movement: what is unsayable? what is unknowable? what remains? Dance and choreographic practices are paradigmatic in this method, because "The body is both a question and an inaccessible answer ... [where] the unseen shimmers, the unheard whispers, the unfelt is caressed and we intuit the unknown."[^heath2011] paradigmatic cases of the problem of knowledge production in practice-research generally, and in dance specifically
    
2. solitude practice: (leadership focused) One hour daily in solitude and silence - "doubts, or questions, or even just difficulties ... can only be found within--without distractions, without peer pressure, in solitude".[^deres2010] This component is speculative and unknown. It's a wildcard. 
    
3. collecting practice: called "unforgettable experiences": collecting hand-written notes/letters of others about memories of watching dance/performance. Key: analogue, experience of watching (vs 'doing' in experimental movement practice above) 

##### + __Traditional scholarship__ 

literature and field review focusing on (analysis of historical and current literature in practice-research (and beyond) re epistemic work to produce annotated bibliography and literature database):

1. history of practice-research, artistic research, practice-led research, practice-based research (etc) around the world, and in particular Scandanavia, UK, and Australia

2. published materials that include discussion of epistemological questions surrounding practice-research  

3. any examples of creative practice projects that explicitly or implicitly explore epistemology

##### + __Case-studies/ethnographic interviews__ 

case-studies/ethnographic interviews - exploring , uncertainty and knowledge production (in a range of practices and disciplines). + leadership/epistemics/uncertainty/humility/epistemic limits. how to identify these cases? Cases ought also to be current practitioners working with PaR -- who would these be? (who are the key figures in dance? (and perhaps beyond). 

Possibilities could be:
    + Bob and Lee
    + Henk Borgdorff
    + Michael Schwab
    + Carol Brown
    + Paul Magee
    + Wendell Berry
    + what about areas like nursing, or care-based practices? Go broader

### Collection 

### Analysis
    
- analysis of these various data? 
    + cataloguing of collected letters/responses (sorting into various kinds of works, responses, years, etc)
    + exploration of creative potential of photographs from main practice


- add pace layers (PARA?) from devonthink as a way of thinking about the 'times' of the parts of the design?
- address climate change in structure/construction of project method and management? 


## Project plan and timetable 

(you are expected to be confident and specific about what you will do, who will do it, when you will do it, and how long it will take – in a realistic approximation)


## Leadership development plan 

>This section of the Case for Support should include details of your proposed leadership activities, and an explanation of why these activities are appropriate to exercising research leadership in your field. You should make clear how these activities enhance the transformational potential of the research and its broader influence and importance. Please refer to Research and leadership activities for further details on what is requirement for this section.

But _Finger Pointing Moon_ is also a project in which the possibilities and limitations of leadership are built into the research design. It is a project _about_ leadership -- "a word to describe significant _actions_ enabling _change_ that is welcomed by affected _people_."[@bendell_leadership_2019] The concept and potential status of leadership is not a funding-led _container_ to bolster my claims to be a practice-research disciplinary leader. Rather, the overarching design is built around leadership that involves _actions_, _change_ and _people_. 

- add something here (or in paragraph after) about these three things (actions, change, people) - something about Bendell's thinking is about responding to the climate crisis. 

>we can be clearer about the kinds of actions that are useful to describe as “leadership” rather than something else, like “management” or “organising”. Leadership actions are those that help shift the way groups, networks or whole communities of people relate and so such actions generate effects over time. [@bendell_leadership_2019]

To generate a flexible set of epistemic principles able to be used across disciplines and practices is a bold aim. It is also an aim that is founded on two seemingly paradoxical values that underpin the nature of leadership: authority and humility. In other words, _who_ has the authority to know, and _how_ might humility act to attenuate such authority? In _Finger Pointing Moon_ I will scrutinise the nature of authority in leadership by working with the radically analogue nature of the human body to examine _who_ gets to know, and _how_ they get to know. The project will be built on first-person research methods to deepen our understanding of two broad areas: creative practice-research, and leadership.

2. To interrogate leadership as a practice of humility, and examine how practices of humility, patience and listening play a role in construction of knowledge. 

- to understand leadership as a practice of humility  
- to build leadership as humility into understanding _who, when and why_ is constructing knowledge 
- focus on collective organising; strategies for collective organising: collecting practice? (this is the bit about 'people' from Bendell)
- leadership/practice connected by corporeal actions: what the body can do, and what the body does (fare: to make and to do)
- examine through practice the role of solitude in understanding leadership, action and change (contrast this with 'group epistemics' from That Thing Produced – actually, not in contrast. I think they sit together quite clearly. (see [@sennett_together_2012 p.21] -- about getting outside yourself)

## Project management 

>How will the project be managed? What will be the roles of the members of staff involved (including you and, if applicable, any Co-Investigator(s), any research assistants)? What is the timetable for the project? Does it include appropriate milestones and is it realistic? When will the outputs of the project be completed? How will you ensure that they meet the needs of your audience? Can the 
costs be justified? How will you ensure good value for money? 
The project management section should also include the management of the digital and data management aspects of the projects, if applicable, and should be coordinated with the information in the Data Management Plan. It should be clear what the milestones for the completion of this element and the work should be incorporated into the timetable for the whole project. The project management of the data management aspects of the project should include an assessment of risk in relation to the complexity and delivery of the project.
If a postdoctoral researcher is to be employed, you should state clearly the nature of the work they will be undertaking and describe clearly the working relationships that are envisaged between all the 
members of the research team. You should describe fully the arrangements for supervising and managing the research assistant. If the researcher is unknown you should state the skills and qualifications sought. Similarly, if the project involves a visit to or a secondment from a member of staff from another organisation, you must state clearly what work they will pursue and describe the 
working relationships envisaged with other members of the team.
In terms of supporting the research staff funded on the project, you should clearly outline the development opportunities which the project will make available. These should include opportunities both in relation to research expertise, and wider opportunities, for example, in connection with the activities proposed in the Pathways to Impact statement.

- value: is the project good value? ? (mention resources, type and quantity/level needed justified in Plan)


## edit bin

- Primarily a first person investigation:[^1st] to grapple with first person experiences in, through and around the body (my body) – to fully wrestle with the uncertainty and unsayable experiences that carve into our flesh

- creative practice-research fieldwork
- history, philosophy
- qualitative research through ethnographic conversations



1. develop two paradigmatic cases of the problem of knowledge production in PaR generally, and in dance specifically: 1) creative practice without outcome (process oriented) - authentic movement; 2) movement art work as film: package-able, shareable, digital, potentially circumvents the _problem_ of documentation
- how are they paradigmatic (either end of spectrum related to production of research practice outcomes)?
