# Finger pointing moon: recognising change through practice-research 

## The Research Problem and Questions

Practice-research is the de-facto means by which artist-scholars make claims for new knowledge in the Academy. However, "no epistemology of artistic research has yet been produced."[@schiesser_what_2015 p.201] _Finger Pointing Moon_ examines the fundamental problem of what is known or understood differently as a consequence of employing practice-research methods. The project tackles this problem via three research questions:

_RQ1 Limits:_ What are the epistemic limits of artistic practice-research? What aspects of practices are not able to be known, understood or articulated? 

_RQ2 Proxies_: What are practice-research's common epistemic proxies and what is their affect on the significance of practice-research as an approach for developing new insights? 

_RQ3 Hyper-specificity_: What language is used to express approaches, findings and failures in practice-research? How can this language be adapted to develop increased dialogue across the research findings and outputs of practice-research artist-scholars?

_Finger Pointing Moon_ uses practice-research to examine the line between what is able to be known and what is not. It is a line we all are navigating: truth, fake news, filter bubbles, datafication of experience, and the analogue sensations of the human body. While _Finger Pointing Moon_'s focus on the epistemic limits of practice-research is niche, the diverse outputs proposed in the research and development components of the fellowship also reveal how epistemic concerns are vital to the wider public.

## Research context 

### Why is it important that the research questions are explored?

_Finger Pointing Moon_ adopts evidence-based empirical fieldwork as a starting point to test practice-research's epistemic possibilities, limitations and failings. The RQs will enable practice-research to move beyond the position where: i) variations of process are circulated and fetishized;[@nelson_practice_2013] ii) representational proxies are assumed to stand in for "epistemic things";[@borgdorff_conflict_2012 p.232] iii) outcomes are rarely explicitly made in dialogue with other overlapping practices;[@biggs_communities_2011] and iv) there are few if any limits to the epistemic claims made on behalf of practice-research and no limits to the vagueness of these claims.[@biggs_communities_2011]

### Other research in this area

Past work to describe an epistemology of practice-research has been theoretical. The concepts of practical knowledge (_technê_) and know-how have been evoked to understand artistic-research specific epistemics.[@borgdorff_debate_2006] This work has failed to distinguish know-how in practice-research from know-how present in any research discipline,[@johnson_embodied_2011] and has not made it clear if practice-research knowledge is located in the artistic artefact and/or with the researcher. 

Scrivener wrote that the "art object does not embody a form of knowledge."[@scrivener_art_2002 n.pag.] Yet Borgdorff suggests that knowledge is "embodied in art practices."[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.13] Even in disagreement, both scholars focus on the limits of the artefact in practice-research and draw the art object's audience into the issue -- Borgdorff through his focus on hermeneutics, and Scrivener through his argument that artefacts require interpretation.[@scrivener_art_2002]  

Other work has built on Scrivener's recognition that the audience is fundamental to the epistemic project of practice-research. Rather than producing knowledge itself, the artist produces "a compelling, mesmerising question"[@magee_introduction._2012 p.5] and the artefact affords possibilities for understanding in those who experience it. This is a radically expanded epistemology in which practice-research is "dependent on its audience to do its epistemic work."[@ellis_that_2018 p.488] 

Most recently, the Journal of Artistic Research publishes what are called expositions of practice. Expositions focus on "particular knowledges" and implicitly valorise vagueness.[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.120] 

### My contribution to improving, enhancing, or developing creativity, insights, knowledge or understanding in the area

The research design of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is based on two propositions: i) that practice-research is not adequately tuned to recognising changes resulting from research-focused artistic practices; ii) body-based practices provide an ideal methodological microscope through which to investigate the epistemic complexity of practice-research.

_Body-based_ practices like choreography and somatics are unique because they have a particularly complex and often fraught relationship with language;[@bauer_no_2019] the experiential nuances are not seen, but felt;[@ellis_corporeal_2020] the practices intersect with contested issues of embodiment and tacit awareness;[@kampe_body-soma-self_2019] and they further complicate problems to do with disappearance, ephemerality and documentation.[@ellis_indelible_2005] 

In _Finger Pointing Moon_ my key contribution to artistic practice-research will occur by moving from deep inside body-based practice towards disciplinary-level theory that attempts to cut through the common vagueness of practice-research outputs and language. The theory will draw practice-research out from behind both technê and epistemic proxies, to understand the limits and margins of practice-research epistemic things. I will also call into question the set of epistemic beliefs that implicitly sustain practice-research. This will mean proposing language for an evidence-based epistemic approach to practice-research while accepting that there are things in practice-research that "may be within the limits of our thought but beyond the limits of our knowledge".[@markie_rationalism_2017 n.p.]

### Who will be most interested in the outcomes? 

The research outcomes will be most interesting to established and emerging scholars from across arts-based disciplines who are working with practice-research. The work will also be valuable to philosophers of epistemology who are researching epistemic edge-cases to do with know-how and testimony. The practice aspects of the research will also be interesting to body-based research specialists grappling with the epistemic potential of their work, and particularly in relation to contested ideas of embodied and tacit knowledge. The developmental components of the project (see Development Plan) are also designed to enhance the scope, reach and impact of the various ideas, data and outcomes. 

## Research methods 

### Which research methods?

The research methods are organised under the RQs they address: 

1. _Limits:_ 

- **Empirical and experiential practice-research fieldwork**: 2 x 3-week blocks (20 hours per week) of Authentic Movement (body-based practice)
- **Experimental documentation** developed through critical reflection with writing and still and moving images
- **Empirical and sensorial observation** through first and third-person observation of the practice
- **Scholarly writing**: first and third-person case report to communicate findings 

2. _Proxies:_

- **Literature and field research and review** of practice-research scholarship and practice to identify any epistemic patterns, ambiguities and proxies
- **Critical analysis** of these materials to develop a theoretical argument regarding the use of epistemic proxies in practice-research
- **Scholarly writing** to understand and communicate findings

3. _Hyper-specificity:_ 

- **Systematic review and meta-analysis** of practice-research field to understand language used to express approaches, findings and failures
- **Critical analysis** of this language to design, propose and share a lexicon of epistemic findings and failures in practice-research

### Why these methods?

>Why have you chosen these methods? Why are they the best way to answer the research questions or problems you have identified? 

>Depending on the approach you are using throughout your research, you may also need to explain clearly the creative and/or performative aspects of the work, explain how you will develop a new process, product or tool, or provide details of who you have consulted or will be involved in the process of research.

The methods address the research questions from the inside through _experimental practice-research_, and the outside through _traditional scholarship_: 

#### Experimental practice-research

The methodological heart of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is the "sustained examination"[@varela_first-person_1999 p.2] of an experimental form of Authentic Movement (AM) as practice-research fieldwork.

AM is a process-oriented movement practice that distinguishes the body as observed from the outside (third-person perspective) and the soma as perceived from the inside (first-person perception).[@hanna_what_1995 p.341] AM provides a highly structured body-based process of empirical (visible) and sensorial (non-visible) observation. Its focus is on doing something rather than making something, and the practice dwells deeply in ambiguous feelings and thoughts and presents movement experiences that are not obviously visible. In _Finger Pointing Moon_ the practice acts as a closed methodological system with which to observe the epistemic limits and possibilities of body-based work. The slipperiness of such contemplative practice, often beyond the reach of "verbalization and of rationalization"[@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.64] and complicated to document, is essential to the project. In _Finger Pointing Moon_ AM is an edge-case or paradigmatic method to examine the epistemic limits, possibilities and failings of body-based practice-research, and to propose extrapolations of these limits to other practice-research disciplines. The practice offers clear and precise limits to wrestle with what can be known differently through practice-research.

In _Finger Pointing Moon_ the practice will involve three people. The first two (Ellis and Whalley) will work with an experimental form of the AM practice and will change between the roles of mover and observer. Over the course of the practice they will adapt it (including using first, second and third-person photography and videography) by experimenting with the limits and possibilities of observable and sensorial experience. This method builds on earlier work by Ellis.[e.g. -@ellis_corporeal_2020] The third collaborator [XX] will act as an external observer to the entire practice. The three roles provide degrees of proximity to the empirical and non-empirical qualities of the practice-research, and provide the means by which to excavate what lies in-between, beneath and behind the artistic practice.

The practice will be documented from within via photography, videography, written and spoken reflections, and from the outside by the third collaborator's detailed observations and analysis.  

In _Finger Pointing Moon_ the artistic practice will be a research outcome (Output 1: Experimental documentation practices) and also applied as an "object of the research"[@borgdorff_conflict_2012 p.146] to underpin the other research methods, outputs and outcomes.  

add something here about concept of visibility/invisibility as a means to slow down and re-orient the method. See zettel concept as method. But perhaps also linked with fuzzy concepts (see same zettel)

see also thinking about lack of conceptual stability in practice-research (same zettel as above). Wondering if this is a bug or a feature. What might happen in an attempt to bring conceptual stability to the methods? Is this possible? What might we agree on? 

#### Traditional scholarship

The experimental practice-research fieldwork will be supplemented by traditional _desk-based_ scholarly methods: systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature and practices, critical analysis and scholarly writing. These methods will make it possible to extrapolate the field-based data (the focus of RQ1) to cross-disciplinary outputs and outcomes that explore the epistemic failures and possibilities of practice-research (RQ2 and RQ3). That is, the traditional scholarly methods will contextualise and broaden the value of the artistic fieldwork.

>Amy: Please elucidate how you will reconcile the methods, data, and analysis from both experimental and traditional. It is not (good) enough to leave each (so called) ‘hanging’. It would be helpful to guide the Reviewer to understand what all your various outputs and outcomes will contribute to the better understanding of which of the 3 RQs and in what way i.e. circle back to your aims (aka reflexive evaluation) of the impact in your discipline (and beyond).

### Copyright or intellectual property issues

The IP for project outputs will belong to PI Ellis at CovUni. The IP for Outputs 1 and 2 will be shared with Whalley and XX. The IP for the three curated talks (Output 10) will belong to the presenters. There are no unusual copyright or IP issues except for the two curated exhibitions (Outputs 3 and 4). The materials for the exhibitions will be used with permission from the original authors and/or will be Creative Commons licensed content. All materials will be fully attributed both in the exhibitions and on the project website. The Discourse forum (Output 9) will be a public online space that requires users to sign-up. It will be moderated by a group of volunteers to ensure no copyright laws are broken (e.g if users were to share unauthorised materials).

## Development plan 

>This section of the Case for Support should include details of your proposed development activities, and an explanation as to why these activities are appropriate to helping you enhance capabilities as research specialists in your field. You should make clear how these activities enhance the transformational potential of the research and its broader influence and importance. Please refer to the Enhancing Research Capabilities in section 1.5 for further details on what is requirement for this section.(p.73)

>In framing your proposal, you will need to clearly articulate a set of activities and to demonstrate both how they will enhance your role within your field, and how they significantly develop your research and its broader influence and importance.(p.26)

>The activities outlined, which should be commensurate with your current career stage and trajectory, should go beyond the kinds of activities that researchers generally undertake in establishing themselves in their disciplines or in the ordinary course of their duties. In other words, the Fellowship offers the opportunity to be innovative in the types of activity which might be taken forward and allows Fellows to explore new avenues. Fellowship proposals should include a substantial programme of collaborative activities and you should be bold in thinking about what is needed to support them.

>When applying to this scheme, fellows will be required to articulate a set of development activities, to demonstrate how they will enhance their profile or status within their field, and how they will develop their research and its broader influence and importance.(p.101 Guide 4.9)

>-to develop capabilities as research specialists and to create opportunities for outreach beyond their research field;
>-to undertake innovative and collaborative development activities, including the initiation of new research, which will result in benefits for their own discipline(s) and beyond.

>How are these all researcher-development activities?

I have been an artist for 30 years, and an artist in the academy for 20 years. In this time, I have pursued and developed individual research practices that have led to small-scale outcomes. I have also tended to resist expansive or wider public dissemination strategies (with the exception of blogging). The project's development plan builds on the research component of this proposal. The plan will enhance my role within practice-research, and significantly develop the influence and importance of my research to artist-scholars by helping me acquire four new capabilities: 1) communicate and contextualise niche and complex ideas about fundamental epistemics of practice-research beyond the practice-research field and also to the wider public; 2) demonstrate leadership in methodological advances in practice-research; 3) develop and support a broad cross-disciplinary community of active artist-scholars; and 4) to create a range of collaborative opportunities with academic and non-academic stake-holders within and outside of dance and the performing arts. 

These four capabilities will be developed through four bold activities and outputs:

_1. Unforgettable_ (Output 3) will be an exhibition of visual and text materials based on a practice of gathering and sharing the public's experiences of dance and movement. Artists, scholars and audiences from around the world will be canvassed to send a written note or letter that describes a single unforgettable moment or experience of dancing. These documents will be collated and organised into an exhibition to be presented by project partners in England and Scotland. _Unforgettable_ builds on the research's epistemic narrative by exploring the role of memory and languages of experience and expression in understanding how we come to know what we know. The process and exhibition is designed to: i) inspire creativity in how other researchers understand and represent the scope of their largely theoretical undertakings; ii) seek wider impact by ambitiously engaging a broad cross-section of participants; iii) develop new and formal research-informed partnerships and collaborations with non-academic organisations in the UK, and informal collaborations with people who submit materials from around the world.

_2. The Un/knowable Body_ (Output 4) will involve collecting a large quantity of cross- and inter-disciplinary audio-visual-text materials that reveal the limits, margins and possibilities of human understanding and experience of the body. These materials will be gathered by the PI and RA and then be sent to two project partners in Australia and Italy. Both project partners will work with their local communities -- in consultation with the PI -- to explore ways to organise, curate, present and respond to the materials and then develop a bespoke programme of events that explore knowledges of the body. _The Un/knowable Body_ directly explores a key part of the research component of _Finger Pointing Moon_ by addressing what is able to be known -- and what remains unknown -- about visual and sensorial experiences of the human body. The activity will: i) foster interdisciplinary research by working with and presenting materials from across disciplinary boundaries; ii) inspire creativity in other researchers by creating models for public engagement that emerge from those publics (rather than top-down or researcher focused models); iii) create wider impact for the research aspects of the project by building relationships between highly theoretical (and niche) ideas to do with epistemology, with accessible and meaningful materials for the wider public; iv) create new research partnerships and collaborations between the PI and project partners working across disciplinary fields.

_3. Artistic Research forum_ (Output 9) will create and support a broad cross-disciplinary community of scholars and artists working in and around practice-research. It will be an online Discourse Forum[^disc] that will modernise old-style email-based list-servs like PARIP and SCUDD, and act as a large-scale _conversation_ on historical, current and future thinking, practices and understandings of practice-research. The forum will be sustained by the discourse community itself with moderation from a large group of experienced and emerging artist-scholars volunteering from around the world; it will, in effect, be a collaboration across the entire practice-research community. This is an ambitious activity that will: i) enable the PI to provide intellectual leadership through an openly accessible network of artist-scholars; ii) inspire creativity and development in other researchers both through materials posted to the forum and through its open and collaborative form; iii) help shape research agendas in which the forum acts like a town-square environment where vital conversations are easily heard and contributed to; and iv) encourage new research collaborations and partnerships as contributors engage with the materials and ideas presented in the forum.

**add that this space will be open to people outside of the academy -- particularly people curious about practice-research if they are thinking of doing a PhD, or how it might be useful to their creative practices**

[^disc]: [www.discourse.org](https://www.discourse.org/)

_4. The Point Beyond_ (Output 8) will be a podcast that explores the limits of what it is to be human. It will initially be limited to two series of eight episodes, and each episode will be a conversation with an expert that explores the point beyond which our understanding and experience falters. The two series will be i) _limits of knowledge_ (e.g. experimental failures; perception and perceptual error; contemplation, cognitive biases, meditation and enlightenment; truth and belief; conspiracy; machine learning and AI); ii) _limits of language_ (e.g. when words fail us; swearing and cussing; language versus direct experience; silence and contemplation; mutism; computer languages and coding). _The Point Beyond_ is a direct attempt to take the research heart of _Finger Pointing Moon_ -- the limits and possibilities of human understanding -- and extrapolate that work into other areas. It will: i) inspire creativity and development in other researchers by building broad cross-disciplinary and wider-public interest in ideas that matter to how we understand being human; ii) directly foster inter- and cross-disciplinary research involving artistic research by building lively and focused conversations with other experts; iii) challenge the PI's ability to communicate complex ideas to a broad audience; iv) focus on clearly and directly on public engagement: why do these niche and largely theoretical ideas matter and to whom? 

## Project management 

>How will the project be managed? What will be the roles of the members of staff involved (including you and, if applicable, any research assistants)? What is the timetable for the project? Does it include appropriate milestones and is it realistic? When will the outputs of the project be completed? How will you ensure that they meet the needs of your audience? Can the costs be justified? How will you ensure good value for money? The project management section should also include the management of the digital and data management aspects of the projects, if applicable, and should be coordinated with the information in the Data Management Plan. It should be clear what the milestones for the completion of this element and the work should be incorporated into the timetable for the whole project. The project management of the data management aspects of the project should include an assessment of risk in relation to the complexity and delivery of the project.
You should describe fully the arrangements for supervising and managing the research assistant. If the researcher is unknown you should state the skills and qualifications sought. Similarly, if the project involves a visit to or a secondment from a member of staff from another organisation, you must state clearly what work they will pursue and describe the working relationships envisaged with other members of the team.
In terms of supporting the research staff funded on the project, you should clearly outline the development opportunities which the project will make available. These should include opportunities both in relation to research expertise, and wider opportunities, for example, in connection with the activities proposed in the Pathways to Impact statement.

>The AHRC is one of the signatories of the RCUK Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers. More information about the Concordat and what it entails can be found here: [ukri.org/files/legacy/skills/review-tor-concordat/](https://www.ukri.org/files/legacy/skills/review-tor-concordat/)

### People and roles

The project will be managed by Ellis (PI, 0.5FTE for months 1-12, 0.8FTE for months 13-18) working with a Research Associate (0.6FTE, 18 months). The PI has experience of managing academic and artistic teams and large research projects, and collaborating with industry partners. The PI will oversee the research methods, supervise and participate in the practice fieldwork and be responsible for overall management of research outcomes and outputs. He will manage the collaborative work with the project partners to ensure open dialogues are sustained, and that the outputs are curated to meet the needs of the partners' audiences, and his own capability development goals. The PI will be supported by an RA who will undertake the desk-based fieldwork and analysis, and contribute to the scholarly writing. The practice fieldwork requires expert input from two people: Joanne 'Bob' Whalley and XX. Whalley is an experienced artist-scholar working at the forefront of experimental documentation and writing practices. She will work with Ellis in the practice fieldwork as an expert practitioner and novice AM practitioner -- an ideal insider-outsider perspective. XX has expertise in ... and their role will be third-person observation, documentation and analysis of the practice fieldwork. Both experts will contribute to Outputs 1 and 2. 

The Research Associate will support the project through bibliographic research, drafting scholarly outputs, event and output organisation, data and website management and a small volume of administration. The RA will be line managed by the PI. They will have daily comms together via a Teams channel, and fortnightly stand-up meetings to review progress, and to make milestone or delivery adjustments. The PI will balance the RA's ongoing professional development, curiosity, skills and understanding, with open communication regarding the project's milestones and outputs. The goal will be to help the RA to develop the skills, experience and confidence to pursue their own research agenda after the completion of the project. The RA will have a practice-research PhD, and will be experienced in bibliographic research, writing and editing; they will be an excellent verbal and written communicator and have advanced digital literacy. 

The project will have a four-person Advisory Group that will meet remotely with the PI at six-month intervals to provide high-level guidance: XX add 4 names. CovUni will allocate additional administrative support to the PI for purchasing, finances, project management and technical support when required.

### Timetable and milestones

Please see the Workplan attachment (Ellis_SK_Workplan.docx) for a complete breakdown of research and development activities undertaken in each month of the project. 

### Digital and data management

We will seek the consent of project partners and contributors to make the project’s outputs available with a CC-BY licence. _Finger Pointing Moon_ will produce multiple Open Access digital outputs online, and all are low risk in relation to the complexity and delivery of the project. The following will be stored on the project's WordPress website hosted by CovUni: i) experimental documentation practices; ii) audio versions of exhibition materials (for visually impaired audiences); iii) selected visual materials from exhibitions; iv) epistemic lexicon; v) blog. Video content produced for the project will be stored securely, compressed for high-definition quality online storage, streaming, and download through C-DaRE's Vimeo account, and embedded in the project website: i) Zoom recordings of curated talks (micro-conferences), ii) video and still-images created during practice-research fieldwork; and iii) desktop documentary (video essay). The Discourse Forum software is open-source and will be hosted and managed by CovUni. The podcast will be hosted off-site at Libsyn, but individual episodes will be embedded in the project website and available freely through Apple Podcasts and Spotify. See Data Management Plan attachment (Ellis_DMP.docx) for further details.

## Outputs, Dissemination and Impact

>The Outputs, Dissemination and Impact section is your opportunity to describe in more detail how the potential impacts of the research will be realised. Information under this heading should build on details given in the Summary and Academic Beneficiaries sections of the Je-S form whilst also elaborating further on other areas of the Case for Support. You should address two main questions: who might benefit from the research and how might they benefit?

>Taking into account what is reasonable and appropriate given the nature of the research you propose to conduct, please provide examples of how the proposed research will be managed to engage any users and beneficiaries that have been identified, or to identify potential users and beneficiaries as the research progresses, and to increase the likelihood of achieving impacts. In presenting your plans, you should tailor and target your dissemination activities to ensure that they are relevant to the specific user and beneficiary groups likely to be interested in your research and appropriate for supporting the potential research impacts outlined.

>You should consider (and address if appropriate) methods for communications and engagement, collaboration and development. You should also detail who will be undertaking any dissemination activities and include any resource implications in the financial summary and in the separate Justification of Resources attachment. Please also explain further how the research will benefit other researchers in the field and – where relevant – academic beneficiaries in other disciplines.

>It is your responsibility to justify the value and appropriateness of the output(s) and outcomes in the Case for Support.

>You are encouraged to disseminate your research and its outcomes to as wide an audience as possible, and where appropriate to engage in communication, dissemination and exploitation activities throughout the period of the project. You should therefore specify the audiences to whom your research could be of interest, and how you propose to engage with those audiences about your research.

_assessment criteria (from assessment-criteria.md):_

>- the appropriateness and effectiveness of the proposed dissemination methods
>- the extent to which the research process is documented or recorded in a way to enable dissemination of research outcomes to the widest possible audience
>- the likelihood that the outputs and outcomes of the project will be highly valued and widely exploited, both in the research community and in wider contexts where they can make a difference
>- whether the plans to increase impact are appropriate and justified, given the nature of the proposed research
>- whether sufficient attention has been given to who the beneficiaries of the research might be and appropriate ways to engage with them throughout the project.

>You should address two main questions: who might benefit from the research and how might they benefit? How will they be identified (including during the research)?

### Outputs

_Finger Pointing Moon_ is driven by research (RES) _and_ developmental (DEV) concerns. The eleven outputs are a wide-range of inter-disciplinary responses to the project's aim to examine the epistemic potential and limits of practice-research. The outputs also challenge the PI to strengthen and broaden his communication, impact and public engagement capacity.

1. Experimental documentation practices, developed through practice-research fieldwork (RES)
2. Scholarly article about epistemic limits (RES)
3. Exhibition _Unforgettable_ (see Development Plan) (DEV)
4. Exhibition _The Un/knowable Body_ (see Development Plan) (DEV)
5. Scholarly article on epistemic proxies (RES)
6. Lexicon of epistemological findings and failures (RES)
7. Desktop documentary (video essay) of key findings of entire research project (RES)
8. Podcast _The Point Beyond_ (see Development Plan) (DEV)
9. Discourse Forum (see Development Plan) (DEV)
10. Three curated talks online (micro-conferences) (RES)
11. Website (including blog) (RES/DEV)

### Identification of end-users and beneficiaries

say who they are first and also strategies for identifying others during the project (make time for this in Workplan)

In _Finger Pointing Moon_ the end-users are the beneficiaries. They will be identified through various systems: collaboration with project partners, word of mouth, comms strategies built into the outputs themselves (e.g. _Unforgettable_, and Discourse Forum), the project team's personal and cross-disciplinary professional networks, in-place social networks (including regular social media and currently existing list-servs) and blogging. 

### Beneficiaries and impacts

The following table outlines possible beneficiaries and impacts for each output.

### Dissemination, public engagement and exploitation

Many of the outputs have community building and public engagement features built in (e.g. Discourse Forum, exhibitions, Podcast and curated micro-conferences). These communities will be brought together through online spaces and by working closely with project partners to develop a 'bottom-up' method to share, discuss and create conversations about the outputs and the project. The partners will also be vital in finding and engaging new audiences as an ongoing aspect of the research and development components. The project's public profile will be supported by C-DaRE and CovUni communication and marketing, and social media and communication systems belonging to the project partners.  

The processes, outcomes and outputs of _Finger Pointing Moon_ will be meticulously documented via the project website to maximise transparency and open accessibility for as wide an audience as possible. All original data from the practice-research fieldwork will be openly accessible for exploitation by other researchers. All draft and completed text materials from all stages of the project (including the development of this fellowship proposal) will be openly accessible through a GitHub repository.[^git] This OA exploitation strategy ensures research transparency and the availability of the ideas, data and outputs for other researchers to transform and publish in accordance with a Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 license. The Discourse Forum will function as an exploitation service to the practice-research community, and the lexicon of failure and findings (Output 6) has the potential to act as a tool for standardisation. The pre-press versions of articles accepted by journals behind paywalls (Outputs 2 and 5) will be made available on the project website. The PI has a strong practice of using clear, direct and simple language and this practice will underpin the project's communication, public engagement and dissemination strategies.
