# Finger pointing moon: recognising change through practice-research 

(Case for Support for an _AHRC Research, Development and Engagement Fellowship_ proposal)

>... they see that language is only a finger pointing at the moon and not the moon itself.[@johnston_cloud_2012 p.2]

>Some aspects of the world may even be beyond the limits of our thought, so that we cannot form intelligible descriptions of them, let alone know that a particular description is true.[@markie_rationalism_2017 n.p.]

## The Research Problem and Questions

Practice-research has two fundamental epistemic questions: 1) What is known or understood differently as a consequence of practice-research methods? 2) How might these understandings be shared and articulated? The second question has been examined in detail through research into documentation and archives.[^doc] However, for nearly 30 years the first question has remained both under-examined and controversial. The aim of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is to tackle this first fundamental epistemic question. 

[^doc]: e.g. Heathfield et al. [-@heathfield_shattered_1997]; Lycouris [@lycouris_documentation_2000]; and Performance Research: _On Archives & Archiving_ (2002, v20:6), _On An/Notations_ (2015, v7:4), _On Disappearance_ (2019, v24:7); See also Journal of Artistic Research and Choreographic Practices. 

The project's aim is underpinned by three epistemic conditions: i) _proxies_; in which genuine research findings are kept at arm's length by concepts, practices or conventions. For example, documentation in practice-research may act as a proxy for evidence;[Kershaw, in @nelson_practice_2013 p.6] ii) _limits_; in which artist-scholars fail to examine the limits of what can and cannot be known through practice-research; and iii) _hyper-specificity_; in which practice-research methods and findings are specific to single projects and rarely form part of critical dialogues in the artistic-scholarly community. 

_Finger Pointing Moon_ has three research questions built on these conditions:

1. _Proxies_: What are practice-research's common epistemic proxies and how does their presence affect the value of practice-research as an approach to understanding the ambiguous and complex experiences of human artistic endeavour? 

2. _Limits:_ What are the epistemic limits of practice-research? What aspects of practices are not able to be known, understood or articulated?

3. _Hyper-specificity_: What language is used to express approaches, findings and failures in practice-research? How might this language be adapted in order to create increased critical dialogue between practice-research artist-scholars?

## Research context 

### Why is it important that the research questions are explored?

Practice-research is not a singular method but rather an overarching approach for working with creative practices in scholarly contexts. The approach has four key characteristics: i) it is first-person, and involves self-critical reflection, or _mesearch_;[@rees_self-reflective_2019] ii) it involves repetition through artistic practice;[@blythe_framework_2016] iii) it has a contested relationship to language and dissemination; and iv) it involves experiences that are ambiguous and/or hidden. These characteristics produce "fuzzy"[@borgdorff_conflict_2012 p.181] epistemic possibilities. Consequently, artist-scholars have an open secret: we usually conceive our research findings _a priori_ and/or present them _a posteriori_ as reflective spaces[@jeremy_bubb_missing_2020] using vague and hopeful language.[^3examples]

[^3examples]: Here are three arbitrary examples from the Journal of Artistic Research (2020 Vol 20, emphasis added): "_hopefully_ as you continue to read and listen, _it will become gradually clearer_" -- Miller; "the open-endedness of artistic research _allows the possibility_ for the ongoing development of _new insights_ among the wider community of creative practitioners" -- Hunt; and "with this text I’m really _not trying to make any grand statements_. It is a _collection_ of words and decisions that function more as a _demonstration_" -- Norman.

The four characteristics outlined above are uniquely amplified for artist-scholars working with body-based practices. By _body-based_ I mean practices like choreography and somatics predicated on the movements, gestures, postures and stillnesses of bodies, and where those same bodies underpin the development of new understandings. What is unique for body-based practices in relation to the key characteristics of practice-research described above is that: they have a particularly complex and often fraught relationship with language;[@bauer_no_2019] the experiential nuances are not seen, but _felt_;[@ellis_corporeal_2020] the practices intersect with contested issues of embodiment and tacit awareness;[@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011; @kampe_body-soma-self_2019] and they further complicate problems to do with disappearance, ephemerality and documentation.[@ellis_indelible_2005; @ledger_question_2011] 

The conception, context and research design of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is therefore founded on two propositions: i) that there is a systemic failure in practice-research to attempt to apprehend the changes and differences resulting from research-focused artistic practices; ii) body-based practices provide a precise and challenging methodological lens through which to investigate the epistemic complexity of practice-research.

The three research questions form the spine of the project's focus for practice-research to adopt a more lucid and evidence-based (empirical) relationship with its own epistemic possibilities, limitations and failings. The alternative to not addressing these questions is the status quo in which endless variations of process are circulated and fetishized,[^fetish] representational proxies are assumed to stand in for "epistemic things",[@rheinberger_toward_1997; see also @borgdorff_conflict_2012 p.232] outcomes are rarely explicitly made in dialogue with overlapping practices,[^theory] and there are no limits to unfalsifiable[^popper] claims to understanding and no limits to the vagueness of these claims. 

[^fetish]: Add list here incling J. of Embodied Research, JAR, and any version of REF. Not surprising because mostly artist-scholars are artists who end up in the university and just want to get to do their practice. The 'market' of journals is simply responding to the desires of artist-scholars

[^theory]: practice-research has (of course) a long history with building relationships with theory. Not as a way to oppose, confront or build theoretical understandings, but more as a way to prop up the academic status of the work. 

[^popper]: Need to be careful here as am calling on a whole different epistemic branch.

In short, if _all_ practice-research is presentable as _truth_ -- even in the sense that "truth is aspirational"[@ingold_search_2018] -- then it is broken as an approach to understanding human experience. I have developed the research questions -- _proxies_, _limits_ and _hyper-specificity_ -- to examine an epistemology of practice-research predicated on empirical _and_ subjective analyses.

### Other research in this area

In 1992 the UK Higher Education Funding Councils first recognised the work of artists as research and, unsurprisingly given the potential "access to highly lucrative government funding",[@magee_introduction._2012 n.p.] art and artists quickly became invested in the production of knowledge. Since then, the epistemological project in practice-research has comprised various attempts to reverse-engineer art-making through an epistemological lens. That is, once art was recognised as research it became necessary to justify and validate its knowledge-producing bona fides, and to avoid a situation in which "the entire history of art [became] eligible for a postgraduate research degree."[@frayling_research_1993 p.5] 

#### The intrinsic-extrinsic debate

This project of creating epistemic justifications for practice-research has been characterised by a continuum bookended by two conflicting positions:[^40k] 1) artistic artefacts require a written statement that synthesises the epistemic status (findings) of the research;[e.g. @noauthor_ref2021_2019; @nelson_practice_2013] 2) artistic artefacts themselves contain and communicate research findings.[e.g. @borgdorff_conflict_2012] **note that these ends of continuum align quite nicely with knowledge being located with the researcher or with the object**

[^40k]: For example, there is a curious contradiction in the UK that a practice-research PhD normally requires approximately 40k words of contextual writing, while a submission to the REF only requires a 300 word summary statement. 

Both positions have inherent problems. The extrinsic position -- that knowledge in practice-research is only revealed or clarified through written contextualisation[@bolt_magic_2007; @smith_practice-led_2009; @candy_role_2010] -- limits the role and importance of the artefact,[@magee_introduction._2012; @borgdorff_debate_2006; @candlin_proper_2000] and sets no margins on the epistemic claims that artistic-scholars make on behalf of their practices. Such claims are rarely "made available for sustained and verifiable peer review".[@haseman_tightrope_2007 n.p.; see also @candy_role_2010] The intrinsic position -- that knowledge is intrinsic to or "embodied in"[@borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.vi] artistic-research artefacts[@ellis_that_2018; @borgdorff_conflict_2012] -- positions ambiguity and uncertainty as epistemic values that usefully produce "less identifiable knowledge products."[@butt_performance_2014 p.114]. Such products act as points of epistemic resistance: they "resist academic conventions of accountability"[@borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.ix] or "ways of knowing that are not able to shape -- or be shaped by -- the various tools and systems of the knowledge economy."[@ellis_that_2018 p.490]  

The tension between intrinsic and extrinsic _claims to knowledge_ in practice-research looms over all practical and theoretical work in the field.[e.g. @borgdorff_foreword_2017 p.ix] It is a conflict founded on: i) the extent to which scholars and regulatory bodies _believe_ that language is needed to describe and justify claims to knowledge;[e.g. @berry_life_2001; @williams_mindfulness_2012] ii) differing perspectives on the limits of artistic practice outcomes to _hold_ and communicate understanding;[e.g. @stephen_scrivener_art_2002; @borgdorff_debate_2006] and iii) the contested relationship between artistic-scholarly outcomes and the pursuit of truth.[e.g. @noe_strange_2015; @ingold_search_2018] 

In _Finger Pointing Moon_ the intrinsic-extrinsic conflict likewise looms over the project's methods, analysis and outcomes. The conflict is the historical epistemic air that the project will breathe. 

#### Past efforts to describe an epistemology of practice-research

Pakes suggests that it is easy to make the claim for a "distinctive kind of knowledge" emerging from practice-research, but far more difficult to specify the make up of such knowledge.[-@pakes_art_2004 n.p.]

##### Know-how and technê

One early solution to the epistemic problem in practice-research was to invoke the concepts of practical knowledge (_technê_) and know-how as a way of understanding artistic-research specific epistemics.[^techne] This work has three problems: 1) It has rarely made it clear where understanding or knowledge is _located:_ in the work of art or with the researcher. 2) It has failed to distinguish know-how in practice-research from the kind of know-how present in any research discipline. That is, what is peculiar to the concept of know-how in artistic practice-research as compared with, for example, engineering or bioethics? 3) It does not explicitly address change(s) as a consequence of research processes -- in any research process the question of what we understand or know differently as a consequence of that process is fundamental. 

[^techne]: This draws on the work of Aristotle, Ryle, Carr and Polanyi, and more recently Pakes. See Borgdorff for an overview.[-@borgdorff_debate_2006]

##### The role of the artefact

Scrivener wrote that the "art object does not embody a form of knowledge."[@stephen_scrivener_art_2002 n.p.] Yet Borgdorff suggests that knowledge is "embodied in art practices (objects, processes)."[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.13] Curiously, even in disagreement, both scholars (inadvertently in Borgdorff's case) ended up focusing on the limits of the artefact in practice-research. In so doing they draw the art object's audience into the issue -- Borgdorff through his focus on hermeneutics, and Scrivener through his argument that 
artworks (or artefacts) require interpretation, and as such might also be called _apprehensions_ or "objects which must be grasped by the senses and the intellect" which when grasped offer "ways of seeing and being".[@stephen_scrivener_art_2002 n.p.]  

##### Audiences

Other work has directly (or indirectly) built on Scrivener's recognition that the audience is fundamental to the epistemic project of practice-research.[^aud] Rather than producing knowledge itself, the artist produces "a compelling, mesmerising question"[@magee_introduction._2012 p.5] and the artefact affords possibilities for understanding in those who experience it. This is a radically "expanded epistemology"[@ellis_that_2018 p.488] in which practice-research is "dependent on its audience to do its epistemic work."[@ellis_that_2018 p.488]  

[^aud]: e.g. Magee [-@magee_introduction._2012]; Ellis [-@ellis_that_2018]. 

These past efforts to describe an epistemology of practice-research reveal the complexity of the problem. There are effectively three _agents_ at play -- the artefact, the artist and the audience -- and the extent to which an artist-scholar foregrounds the role of each has determined their position in attempting to understand the epistemic boundaries of practice-research. What is shared between the positions is an overarching relativist constructivist framework. Such a framework gives license to the artist-scholar (and/or the audience) to say anything about the work they present and represent; that is, there are no limits to the claims that are made. 

### My contribution to improving, enhancing, or developing creativity, insights, knowledge or understanding in the area

>Some aspects of the world may be within the limits of our thought but beyond the limits of our knowledge; faced with competing descriptions of them, we cannot know which description is true. Some aspects of the world may even be beyond the limits of our thought, so that we cannot form intelligible descriptions of them, let alone know that a particular description is true.[@markie_rationalism_2017 n.p.]

- empirical
- draw together large range of ideas, opinions and histories that have attempted to handle the epistemology of practice-research
- where the large body of work has used (often by default) a relativist approach to making epistemic claims, my ambition is to incorporate rationalism, and empiricism
- to speak directly to the problems -- push through the fuzziness
- creating language for this empirical approach

- proxy is very different from staring into the belly of not knowing. Accepting the possibility of not knowing or there are things that are not able to be known 
- I am not proposing evidence evidence evidence. Tension between evidence, and allowing the creative work to do its work.

- to address the idea that practice-research's place is an epistemic place (and not to stay within realm of techne). to know something differently. to know-that. this is not to reduce or displace know-how or craft. ties to Rheinberger and building epistemic things.
- but what is the nature of this epistemic place? can something that is unknowable (akin to Berry's thinking) except through direct experience (ref from obsidian) be an epistemic thing? And if not, what kind of _thing_ is it? 
- some kind of line between what is observable and standpoint epistemology

interested not only in what we can agree on but what we can clearly disagree about on. what can't be said? some things must be open to debate (other than just methodology). Where is there legitimate disagreement? (heterotopic discourse -- ways of arguing) -- similar to Biggs and Buchler (2011) approach, p.83 of the chapter in their edited volume.

### Who will be most interested in the outcomes? 

- artist-scholars from various disciplines working in and through practice-research
- graduate and postgraduate students working in practice-research across disciplines
- philosophers / epistemologists
- body-based specialists grappling with understanding their work as potentially epistemic things (and claims to knowledge)


### Research objectives

The aim of _Finger Pointing Moon_ is to address practice-research's fundamental epistemic question: _What can we know or understand differently as a consequence of practice-research?_ This aim is addressed by three research questions -- _Proxies_, _Limits_ and _Hyper-specificity_ -- that are themselves underpinned by [XX] objectives as follows. 

_1. Proxies:_

1. complete in-depth survey of practice-research epistemology literature from the early 1990s (when practice-research began in the academy) to the present
2. identify and critique any epistemic ambiguities/limitations/possibilities in this scholarship
3. identify epistemic proxies of practice-research -- these are the ways in which practice-research represents its understandings or _findings_ while keeping them at arm's length
4. propose analysis of the affects of epistemic proxies on epistemic clarity and specificity in practice-research  

_2. Limits:_

2. _Limits:_ What are the epistemic limits of practice-research? What experiences and aspects of practices are not able to be known, understood or articulated?

5. identify qualities of experience from first-person body-based practice experiments that resist being known, are deeply uncertain, or are unable to be articulated
6. identify qualities of experience from first-person body-based practice experiments that assist being known, display some quality of certainty, or are able to be articulated 
6. categorise and organise these qualities of experience into a "lexicon of un/knowing in body-based practice-research"  

and discuss if required propose precise, clear alternatives that speak directly to the epistemic limits and possibilities of body-based practice-research 


_3. Hyper-specificity:_

7. _Hyper-specificity_: What language is typically used to express findings and failures in practice-research? How might this language be developed, adapted or reconfigured in order to create increased critical dialogue between practice-research artist-scholars and their projects?

8. generate set of epistemic principles underpinning body-based practice-research, with particular attention on findings, failures and indescribables

9. generate set of epistemic values in body-based practice-research that transparently and rigorously detail examples of "who, when [and] why is creating knowledge."[@mignolo_epistemic_2009 p.160]

10. examine the potential of proposed body-based epistemic principles and values to be generalisable to other forms of practice-research

## Research methods 

>What research methods will you be using to address the questions or issues that you have set yourself, or solve the problems you have identified, or to explore the matters you intend to investigate? Why have you chosen these methods? Why are they the best way to answer the research questions or problems you have identified? What will be your role? If there are other people involved, what will their roles be and why are they the appropriate people to be involved? 

>In describing your research methods it is not sufficient to state, for example, that you intend to visit a particular archive, or an exhibition abroad. You must provide adequate details of sources to be consulted, and you should state briefly what kinds of material you will be consulting, why they are relevant to your programme of research, and how you will interrogate them. Depending on the approach you are using throughout your research, you may also need to explain clearly the creative and/or performative aspects of the work, explain how you will develop a new process, product or tool, or provide details of who you have consulted or will be involved in the process of research.



>convince decision makers that ‘this is the best solution’ and feel compelled to fund it – (approx >50% of content); 

>Creative output can be produced, or practice undertaken, as an integral part of a research process as defined above. The Council would expect, however, this practice to be accompanied by some form of documentation of the research process, as well as some form of textual analysis or explanation to support its position and as a record of your critical reflection. Equally, creativity or practice may involve no such process at all, in which case it would be ineligible for funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council.(p.11)

### Why these methods? 

The research methods are designed to create the conditions in which to directly respond to and _achieve_ the project objectives. These objectives, in turn, feed directly into the three research problems, which underpin the primary research aim. The research questions -- _proxies_, _limits_, and _hyper-specificity_ -- are 'meta' or wide-angle problems in practice-research. The following methods are appropriate to the breadth of these problems, while affording detail where necessary. The methods are multi-modal, and comprise empirical practice-research fieldwork, lived experience as a dance artist-researcher, personal communications, interviews with key thinkers-practitioners and supplemental scholarly research to understand experiences and understandings of practice-research epistemics from the inside (through experimental practice) and the outside (through traditional scholarship). They are detailed below, and are organised under the three overarching problems they directly address.  

discuss body-based in this paragraph above

The three issues -- _proxies_, _limits_, and _hyper-specificity_ -- also act as a conceptual structure for the research design.

### Methods

1. _Proxies_: expert opinion, literature-based research

- Comprehensive literature review of body-based practice-research scholarship that emphasises embodied and tacit knowledge
- Critical and theoretical analysis of the language used in these scholarly (and practice-oriented) materials to identify any epistemic patterns, ambiguities and oversights
- Creative and analytical 'reconfiguration' (where necessary or appropriate) of these linguistic patterns that reveal the presence or absence of an epistemic proxy (in other words, what epistemic possibilities are not being discussed or are being glossed over?)  

2. _Limits:_ first-person and (second?) third-person case-report


link between first-person-ness of PaR and somatics; soma -- first person: <the field of somatics.md>.


- what might the "technologies of investigation"[@gramelsberger_laboratory_2013 p.104] be in par? 
- what do I imagine the objects of investigation to be in this work?

- clarify use of AM: what is it's function? how does it work? what claims can be made? the concept of efficacy is critical here? why this technique/practice and not another or others? This is based on reading [@ginot_shustermans_2010]

- traditional scholarship: literature and field (practice) review of published materials that implicitly and/or explicitly examine epistemics of body-based practice (some overlap of materials examined in Problem 1)**What do I do with this review? Need to add something here to this method**

    + develop annotated bibliography of 50-100 key published materials and present on project website [output] 
- practice-research: process-driven experimental movement practice as paradigmatic (or edge-case) example of epistemics limits and possibilities in practice-research 
    + practice will be 4 x 2 week sessions of Authentic Movement (four hours per day, 5 days per week = 20 hours per week). Authentic Movement is an edge-case example of practice-research because it is clearly process-orientated, dwells deeply in ambiguous or hard to pin-down feelings and thoughts, presents movement experiences that are not obviously visible and thereby effectively impossible to document, and has an ambivalent relationship to the written word
    + includes speculative and/or experimental documentation practices using still and moving images and written responses [output]
    + analytical reflection on the practice in order to propose what can and cannot be known about experiences in this practice, and other body-based practices more generally 
    + scholarly journal article that takes a quasi third-person perspective on this research: its limits, misses, problems, mistakes [output]
    
- practice-research: collecting practice of 'unforgettable experiences of body-based practice/performance', called _Unforgettable_
    + not at all clear how this practice relates to the RQs
    + invite and collect notes and letters from scholars, artists and wider public about first-hand memories of watching and doing dance and/or performance
    + catalogue these collected letters and responses into various kinds of works, responses, years, etc
    + cataloguing process will result in a small-scale exhibition to be presented at various performance spaces in the UK [output]
- practice-research: collecting practice of materials, traces, ideas, notes, and thoughts on corporeal epistemics: _The Un/knowable Body_
    + gather materials throughout the research project
    + organise these materials into emergent patterns (based on not yet known characteristics) 
    + develop exhibition of these materials to be presented at movement research centres nationally and internationally [output]

3. _Hyper-specificity_: systematic review and meta-analysis

systematic review and meta-analysis

- traditional scholarship: critically analyse the data sets from problem 2 to propose broad-ranging epistemic values and principles for body-based practice-research
    + pay particular attention to language of findings, failures and indescribables from literature and field review in problem 2 
    + collate this 'language of findings' in relation to Mignolo's proposition that we must focus on the knower (and not the known), and in particular "who, when [and] why is creating knowledge."[@mignolo_epistemic_2009 p.160]
    + propose sets of epistemic principles and values underpinning body-based practice-research [output]
    + categorise and organise these qualities of experience into a "lexicon of epistemology in body-based practice-research"[^wheel] [output] -- 



### People and roles


### Copyright or intellectual property issues

>Under the Research Methods heading you should also outline how any copyright or intellectual property issues relating to the project and the production of any outputs will be addressed.

## Development plan 

>This section of the Case for Support should include details of your proposed development activities, and an explanation as to why these activities are appropriate to helping you enhance capabilities as research specialists in your field. You should make clear how these activities enhance the transformational potential of the research and its broader influence and importance. Please refer to the Enhancing Research Capabilities in section 1.5 for further details on what is requirement for this section.(p.73)

>In framing your proposal, you will need to clearly articulate a set of activities and to demonstrate both how they will enhance your role within your field, and how they significantly develop your research and its broader influence and importance.(p.26)

>The activities outlined, which should be commensurate with your current career stage and trajectory, should go beyond the kinds of activities that researchers generally undertake in establishing themselves in their disciplines or in the ordinary course of their duties. In other words, the Fellowship offers the opportunity to be innovative in the types of activity which might be taken forward and allows Fellows to explore new avenues. Fellowship proposals should include a substantial programme of collaborative activities and you should be bold in thinking about what is needed to support them.


>First let’s establish that the concept of “individualization” should not be confused with the neoliberal ideology of “individualism” that shifts all responsibility for success or failure to a mythical, atomized, isolated individual, doomed to a life of perpetual competition and disconnected from relationships, community, and society. Neither does it refer to the psychological process of “individuation” that is associated with the lifelong exploration of self-development. Instead, individualization is a consequence of long-term processes of modernization.[@zuboff_age_2019 Chapter 2.2]

- thinking about individuation (relating to solitude) v individualism (opposite of Bendell)
- communications development will be key aspect of my approach/desire. why? within academy? what do we gain/lose from improved communications? wrestling with the bubbles. Comms will demand 

solitude and collective
use a practice -- it's how I come to understand things
+ practice-research: solitude practice (speculative _wildcard_)

solitude practice: One hour daily in solitude and silence - "doubts, or questions, or even just difficulties ... can only be found within--without distractions, without peer pressure, in solitude".[@deresiewicz_solitude_2010] This component is speculative and unknown. It's a wildcard. 



>we can be clearer about the kinds of actions that are useful to describe as “leadership” rather than something else, like “management” or “organising”. Leadership actions are those that help shift the way groups, networks or whole communities of people relate and so such actions generate effects over time. [@bendell_leadership_2019]



## Project management 

>How will the project be managed? What will be the roles of the members of staff involved (including you and, if applicable, any Co-Investigator(s), any research assistants)? What is the timetable for the project? Does it include appropriate milestones and is it realistic? When will the outputs of the project be completed? How will you ensure that they meet the needs of your audience? Can the 
costs be justified? How will you ensure good value for money? 
The project management section should also include the management of the digital and data management aspects of the projects, if applicable, and should be coordinated with the information in the Data Management Plan. It should be clear what the milestones for the completion of this element and the work should be incorporated into the timetable for the whole project. The project management of the data management aspects of the project should include an assessment of risk in relation to the complexity and delivery of the project.
If a postdoctoral researcher is to be employed, you should state clearly the nature of the work they will be undertaking and describe clearly the working relationships that are envisaged between all the 
members of the research team. You should describe fully the arrangements for supervising and managing the research assistant. If the researcher is unknown you should state the skills and qualifications sought. Similarly, if the project involves a visit to or a secondment from a member of staff from another organisation, you must state clearly what work they will pursue and describe the 
working relationships envisaged with other members of the team.
In terms of supporting the research staff funded on the project, you should clearly outline the development opportunities which the project will make available. These should include opportunities both in relation to research expertise, and wider opportunities, for example, in connection with the activities proposed in the Pathways to Impact statement.

>Your Fellowship project can be up to 18 months (min at 0.5FTE max at 1.0FTE) but the research assistance can be up to a total 12 months of full time distributed over the 18-month period.
In other words, RA can work up to the maximum at (12/18) FTE for 18 months or 1.0 FTE for 12 months. 
See page 20, section Research Assistance. (from Amy)

## Outputs, Dissemination and Impact

>The Outputs, Dissemination and Impact section is your opportunity to describe in more detail how the potential impacts of the research will be realised. Information under this heading should build on details given in the Summary and Academic Beneficiaries sections of the Je-S form whilst also elaborating further on other areas of the Case for Support. You should address two main questions: who might benefit from the research and how might they benefit?

>Taking into account what is reasonable and appropriate given the nature of the research you propose to conduct, please provide examples of how the proposed research will be managed to engage any users and beneficiaries that have been identified, or to identify potential users and beneficiaries as the research progresses, and to increase the likelihood of achieving impacts. In presenting your plans, you should tailor and target your dissemination activities to ensure that they are relevant to the specific user and beneficiary groups likely to be interested in your research and appropriate for supporting the potential research impacts outlined.

>You should consider (and address if appropriate) methods for communications and engagement, collaboration and development. You should also detail who will be undertaking any dissemination activities and include any resource implications in the financial summary and in the separate Justification of Resources attachment. Please also explain further how the research will benefit other researchers in the field and – where relevant – academic beneficiaries in other disciplines.

- OUTPUT 9: discourse forum: a site for students, potential students, artist-researchers, other disciplines; create with group of people from around the world: look to get 50-100 active users in first year [W] DEV
    + plan for maintenance and sustainability
- OUTPUT 10: 5 curated talks online (micro-conferences) [W - but curated towards each of 3 problems] DEV
    + e.g. [lesswrong.com/posts/9m9SniwdKsKyfjrMw/inviting-curated-authors-to-give-5-min-online-talks](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9m9SniwdKsKyfjrMw/inviting-curated-authors-to-give-5-min-online-talks)
    + these could be held by people who have contributed to the project blog or the podcasts? 
- OUTPUT 11: article for The Conversation [W] RES / DEV - **remove this**
- OUTPUT 12: project website and blog [W] RES

- OUTPUT 13: github site (radical transparency) [W] DEV
    + basically a downloadable version of all texts from the website

- key question for me here is how do non-academics benefit from this work? this is probably why that practice for theatre exhibitions is useful. It gets back to the Snowden thing.


+ Outputs and Dissemination (what you will do with the knowledge) for your audience:
    * To Beneficiaries – who are they
    * To End Users – who are they?
    * What is the plan to exploit outcomes to beneficiaries and end users (short description)
    * Will there be Public Engagement?

  


## other things to consider

- my skills and experience (competence)
- value: is the project good value? ? (mention resources, type and quantity/level needed justified in Plan)
