# what, why and why

_What do I do?_ 

I work at the boundary between academic research and art making, and particularly art that explores the experiences and possibilities of the body. I seek ways to make research relevant to artists and the wider public. I do this in collaboration with organisations and their audiences.

_Why do I do it?_

I do it because I am convinced that developing our awareness of the body -- and our capacity to sense it both in everyday and extraordinary circumstances -- is fundamental to leading a rich and healthy life. Our culture's emphasis on cognitive power too easily consigns our bodies to mere transport systems for our brains. We forget that the body is our primary instrument that makes perception, sensing and thinking possible. 

_Why do I think it works?_

It works because it brings awareness and understanding of the body into relationship with the complex and emotionally rich lives of people. It works because our bodies make being together and being in relationship with each other possible.
