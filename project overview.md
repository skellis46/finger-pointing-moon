# finger pointing moon - overview

## overview

There has been – and continues to be -- an epistemic crisis in practice-as-research. This crisis has various descriptions, components or histories including (list them). What these pasts have in common is the _recognition_ that there are experiences afforded by this experimental set of methods known as PaR that are _unable to be known and/or articulated_. (epistemic routines of PaR). For some this humbling limitation is a weakness (refs), and for others a strength (refs). This project – Finger Pointing Moon – examines the heart of this crisis. It does this by ... two broad ways: practices/leadership. 
- nature of the practices: defy two things - a) capacity to be accurately and wholly articulated (or shared); b) analogue human experiences ("exceed algorithmic description")
- epistemic crisis of PaR: yet to deal coherently and rigorously with what _can_ be said (and not said) about our artistic-scholarly practices that is based on the materiality or substance of the practices themselves. Instead, more or less, we just make things up OR we hope the practices do something.
- possible to link leadership thoughts about 'affected people' below with 'crowd epistemics' from That Thing Produced? 
- dance presents an invaluable set of limitations/possibilities (explain delimiting of dance to body movement that is not text-orientated or based?). 
- exploring the nature of things that cannot be described (and implications for role and work of artistic-research in academy)
- relationship to datafication? 
- If the key epistemic question is "who, when, why is constructing knowledges?"[@mignolo_epistemic_2009] then in this work I take one part of this question and discuss the epistemic _why_ of experiences that are unable to be discussed. They are experiences of politics and humility that underpin the radically analogue nature of the human body; they are experiences that exceed "algorithmic description";[@odell_how_2019] perhaps they are even experiences or _acts_ of "epistemic disobedience".[@mignolo_epistemic_2009]

>leadership is a word "to describe significant actions enabling change that is welcomed by affected people. -- Bendell [-@bendell_leadership_2019]

- what kinds of significant actions?
- what might these 'changes' be?
- who are the ‘affected people’ in this context?
- who are the groups, networks or whole communities of people?
- what kinds of effects over time?

## useful words

## aim

Develop, critique and share epistemic principles for practice-as-research

## objectives 

- generate and critically examine three PaR practices for which their epistemic possibilities are radically different. Also come from different positions of "leadership" 
- research and produce annotated bibliography of PaR literature that refers to its history and its epistemic possibilities and limits
- examine through practice the role of solitude in understanding leadership, action and change (contrast this with 'group epistemics' from That Thing Produced)
- leadership/practice connected by corporeal actions: what the body can do, and what the body does (fare: to make and to do)
- focus on collective organising; strategies for collective organising: collecting practice?

## hybrid method

1. practice-as-research fieldwork through three distinct practices
    a) experientially rich movement: that which cannot be described or known (with research consultant: what can't be said? then what remains? (name for such a method?)) - from the perspective of doing. Dance and choreographic practices are paradigmatic in this case: 
>Choreography is a corporeal passage in which the body is both a question and an inaccessible answer. Choreography is the indecipherable language of bodies presented for interpretation. In choreography the negative comes into presence: the unseen shimmers, the unheard whispers, the unfelt is caressed and we intuit the unknown.[@heathfield_what_2011]
    
    b) solitary practice (leadership focused) - "doubts, or questions, or even just difficulties ... can only be found within--without distractions, without peer pressure, in solitude." -- [@deresiewicz_solitude_2010 np]
    c) collecting practice called "unforgettable experiences": collecting hand-written notes/letters of others about memories of watching dance/performance. Key: analogue, experience of watching (v 'doing' in 'a' above)
2. literature and field review: analysis of past and present through published materials (RA heavily responsible)
3. cross-disciplinary case studies/interviews: leadership/epistemics/uncertainty/humility/epistemic limits -- how to identify these cases? Cases ought also to be current practitioners working with PaR -- who would these be? (who are the key figures in dance? (and perhaps beyond). Possibilities could be:
    + Bob and Lee
    + Henk Borgdorff
    + Michael Schwab
    + Carol Brown
    + Paul Magee
    + what about areas like nursing, or care-based practices? Go broader
- analysis of these various data? 
    + cataloguing of collected letters/responses (sorting into various kinds of works, responses, years, etc)
- address climate change in structure/construction of project method and management? 


## potential partners 

- Siobhan Davies Dance
- Yorkshire Dance
- The Workroom (Glasgow)
- Chisenhale Dance Space

- Sadlers Wells 
- continue thinking about this (will depend on how project develops)

## potential outputs

### definite 
- OA desktop documentary exploring PaR epistemic principles (key output)
    + auxiliary-output: OA film from quiver/unstable work with RC
    + auxiliary-output: OA visual trace (e.g. photo series from authentic movement practice with RC - building on work with Shaun McLeod in 2019)
- website: a) annotated bibliography; b) bi-weekly blog post; c) collecting materials and traces of project
- github site for all text materials - radically transparent and OA
- symposium (e.g. using Radhoc’s Unpanel or another Unconference idea[^1]) 
- materials wall exhibition (similar to Eliasson) -- could be kept up for a while at SDD and even installed in other spaces = resources, insights, notes, images (need to consider how to store this, any copyright issues, broaden beyond practices )
- journal article: principles of par epistemics

### maybe

- one-on-one public workshops/experiences exploring AM and ways of knowing
- podcast? 
- OA publication for wider public: What Does Dance Know? (e.g. leanpub? with illustrations?)
 
## academic beneficiaries 

- PaR scholars (cross-disciplinary)
- dance studies scholars
- theatre and performance studies scholars
- PaR PhD (and other PG) students 

## non-academic beneficiaries

- artists
- wider public (about why our bodies matter)
-

## edit bin

5. group online activity (with associated chat) - like a youtube live stream/chat -- not so dissimilar from an online tutorial or open conversation?
6. method designed to minimise carbon production (no flights, no cars, as local as possible: limitations are obvious re digital technologies, server storage, any online activity, vital to keep it outward looking and international. Balancing local and global.)
