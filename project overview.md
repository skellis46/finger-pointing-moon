# finger pointing moon - overview

## overview

- epistemic crisis of PaR: yet to deal coherently and rigorously with what _can_ be said about our artistic-scholarly practices that is based on the materiality or substance of the practices themselves. Instead, more or less, we just make things up OR we hope the practices do something.
- possible to link leadership thoughts about 'affected people' below with 'crowd epistemics' from That Thing Produced? 
- dance presents an invaluable set of limitations/possibilities (explain delimiting of dance to body movement that is not text-orientated or based?). 
- exploring the nature of things that cannot be described (and implications for role and work of artistic-research in academy)
- relationship to datafication? 
- If the key epistemic question is "who, when, why is constructing knowledges?"[@mignolo_epistemic_2009] then in this work I take one part of this question and discuss the epistemic _why_ of experiences that are unable to be discussed. They are experiences of politics and humility that underpin the radically analogue nature of the human body; they are experiences that exceed "algorithmic description";[@odell_how_2019] perhaps they are even experiences or _acts_ of "epistemic disobedience".[@mignolo_epistemic_2009]

>leadership is a word "to describe significant actions enabling change that is welcomed by affected people. -- Bendell [-@bendell_leadership_2019]

- what kinds of significant actions?
- what might these 'changes' be?
- who are the ‘affected people’ in this context?
- who are the groups, networks or whole communities of people?
- what kinds of effects over time?

## useful words 

datafication | resolution | change | practice-as-research | dance | epistemology | data | analogue | digital | archive | documentation | 

## aim

Develop, critique and share epistemic principles for practice-as-research

## objectives 

- generate and critically examine two PaR case-studies for which their epistemic possibilities are radically different 
- research and produce annotated bibliography of PaR literature that refers to its history and its epistemic possibilities and limits
- examine through practice the role of solitude in understanding leadership, action and change (contrast this with 'group epistemics' from That Thing Produced)
- leadership/practice connected by corporeal actions: what the body can do, and what the body does (fare: to make and to do)
- focus on collective organising; strategies for collective organising (e.g. 1 hr solitude per week outside: connect with two people on this -- and so do they, etc.)

## sum requested

- ??

## time

- 18 month project, commencing June 2021

## personnel

- 1 x 0.6 PI (Ellis)
- 1 x 0.5 RA (TBC) 
- 1 x research consultant (Lalitarāja?)


## hybrid method

1. fieldwork through paradigmatic practice-as-research with research consultant 
2. literature and field review: analysis of past and present through published materials (RA heavily responsible)
3. fieldwork through solitary practice (leadership focused)
4. cross-disciplinary case studies/interviews: leadership/epistemics/uncertainty/humility -- how to identify these cases? Cases ought also to be current practitioners working with PaR -- who would these be? (who are the key figures in dance? (and perhaps beyond). Possibilities could be:
    + Susan Kozel
    + Bob and Lee
    + Adrian Heathfield
    + Henk Borgdorff
    + Michael Schwab
    + Carol Brown
    + Paul Magee
    + what about areas like nursing, or care-based practices? Go broader
5. group online activity (with associated chat) - like a youtube live stream/chat -- not so dissimilar from an online tutorial or open conversation?
6. method designed to minimise carbon production (no flights, no cars, as local as possible: limitations are obvious re digital technologies, server storage, any online activity, vital to keep it outward looking and international. Balancing local and global.)


## potential partners 

- Siobhan Davies Dance
- Yorkshire Dance
- The Workroom (Glasgow)
- Chisenhale Dance Space
- The Place
- continue thinking about this (will depend on how project develops)

## potential outputs

### definite 
- OA desktop documentary exploring PaR epistemic principles (key output)
    + auxiliary-output: OA film from quiver/unstable work with RC
    + auxiliary-output: OA visual trace (e.g. photo series from authentic movement practice with RC - building on work with Shaun McLeod in 2019)
- website: a) annotated bibliography; b) bi-weekly blog post; c) collecting materials and traces of project
- github site for all text materials - radically transparent and OA
- symposium (e.g. using Radhoc’s Unpanel or another Unconference idea[^1]) 
- materials wall exhibition (similar to Eliasson) -- could be kept up for a while at SDD and even installed in other spaces = resources, insights, notes, images (need to consider how to store this, any copyright issues, broaden beyond practices )
- journal article: principles of par epistemics

### maybe

- one-on-one public workshops/experiences exploring AM and ways of knowing
- podcast? 
- OA publication for wider public: What Does Dance Know? (e.g. leanpub? with illustrations?)
 
## academic beneficiaries 

- PaR scholars (cross-disciplinary)
- dance studies scholars
- theatre and performance studies scholars
- PaR PhD (and other PG) students 

## non-academic beneficiaries

- artists
- wider public (about why our bodies matter)
-
