## brief summary

_aim:_

to develop an original set of practice-research epistemic principles

_context:_ 

i) the limits of embodied practice-research, and the datafication of experience;  
ii) leadership as a practice of humility, and strategies for affecting change

_rationale:_ 

Leadership is not about the "power of a significant individual at the top of a hierarchy".[^ben1] Rather it is a word to describe significant yet "fluid and humble"[^ben2] _actions_ that affect change. Leadership as a practice of humility provides a wide-angle lens through which to understand the limits and possibilities of practice-research. To develop principles of practice-research epistemics it's necessary to understand the contemporary context for constructing knowledges. The context for _who, when and why_ is constructing knowledge is the pervasive datafication of human experience. A process-driven experimental movement practice provides a paradigmatic and analogue case-study for testing the intersection of the limits of datafication, and what we can and can not understand differently as a consequence of practice-research. 

_research design:_

1. research focus 1: leadership
    + case-studies/ethnographic interviews - exploring leadership, uncertainty and knowledge production (in a range of practices and disciplines)
2. research focus 2: practice-research
    + practice-research fieldwork consisting of three distinct practices: 
        1. process-driven experimental movement practice;  
        2. solitude practice
        3. collecting practice   
    + literature and field review focusing on:
        1. 

_objectives:_

- to understand leadership as a practice of humility  
- to build leadership as humility into understanding _who, when and why_ is constructing knowledge  
- to generate and critically examine three research practices for which their epistemic possibilities are radically different. Also come from different positions of "leadership" 
- research and produce annotated bibliography of PaR literature that refers to its history and its epistemic possibilities and limits
- examine through practice the role of solitude in understanding leadership, action and change (contrast this with 'group epistemics' from That Thing Produced – actually, not in contrast. I think they sit together quite clearly. (see [@sennett_together_2012 p.21] -- about getting outside yourself)
- epistemic principles in practice-research
- epistemic values in practice-research 
- leadership/practice connected by corporeal actions: what the body can do, and what the body does (fare: to make and to do)
- focus on collective organising; strategies for collective organising: collecting practice? 

_outputs:_



## context

There is an epistemic crisis in body-based practice-research. It is a crisis revealed by the sharp rise in scholarship exploring the nature of embodied knowledge.[^ek] In much of that research, the idea that the body _knows_ acts as a proxy for the epistemic limitations of practice-research investigations. In other words, dance artist-scholars who research through movement practices are valorising the concept of embodied knowledge while failing to address the key epistemic paradox of creative practice-research: that its ontology lies at least in part in what is _not_ able to be known, understood or articulated as a consequence of body-based creative practices.[^ttp1] This is a humbling limitation for any research method or process.

The inescapable contemporary cultural backdrop for the tension between embodied knowledge, the unknowable, and the inarticulable is the datafication of human experience. In 2017 _The Economist_ declared that the "world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data".[^econ] We live in what Zuboff calls the age of _surveillance capitalism_ that is founded on "extractive operations in which our personal experiences are scraped and packaged as the means to others’ ends".[^zub1] The cultural and financial capital of understanding the world-as-data means it is not surprising that precarious and delicate artistic practices and processes located in and through the body – like dance and somatics – have also become enamoured by the doctrine of datafication. The rapidly growing number of online archives, digital forms of documentation, and virtual and augmented reality projects are all implicit or explicit attempts by dance scholars to transform the radically analogue nature of embodied experiences into data.[^plethora] 

This research leadership project called _Finger Pointing Moon_ is underpinned by these two phenomena: the limitations of embodied practice-research, and the datafication of experience. These phenomena are related because the construction and production of knowledge in any scholarly field is never based on the simple and objective observation of worldly phenomena. Rather, to understand what we say we know and do not know, the vital epistemic question is in fact "who, when, [and] why is constructing knowledges?"[^mig1] If the overwhelming contemporary phenomenon is the extraction of data from human experiences, then the question of _who, when and why is constructing knowledges_ necessitates an encounter with the limits and excesses of datafication. 

In this project, I propose that complex and radically analogue human experiences like experimental choreographic and movement practices have ontologies that are underpinned by two key characteristics: a) they defy the capacity to be accurately and wholly articulated and shared; and b) they exceed "algorithmic description".[^odell1] _Finger Pointing Moon_ is positioned squarely at the intersection of the datafication of human experience and the limitations of embodied practice-research. It is a project designed around creative practices that resist datafication, understanding and articulation, and the overarching purpose of the design is to create the conditions in which to develop an original set of practice-research epistemic principles. 

To generate a flexible set of epistemic principles able to be used across disciplines and practices is a bold aim. It is also an aim that is founded on two seemingly paradoxical values that underpin the nature of leadership: authority and humility. In other words, _who_ has the authority to know, and _how_ might humility act to attenuate such authority? In _Finger Pointing Moon_ I will scrutinise the nature of authority in leadership by working with the radically analogue nature of the human body to examine _who_ gets to know, and _how_ they get to know. The project will be built on first-person research methods to understand two broad areas: creative practice-research, and leadership.

### Creative practice-research

Practice-research is a fundamentally, and historically first-person strategy that therefore demands we focus on the knower. What is known is unequivocally dependent on the knower, and unless we ...:

>in order to call into question the modern/colonial foundation of the control of knowledge, it is necessary to focus on the knower rather than on the known. 

– [@mignolo_epistemic_2009 p.162]


I'm interested in mobilising the knower, in critiquing the knower. The assumptions of the knower. The prejudices of the knower. The assertions of the knower. The power of the knower. The limitations of the knower.

### Leadership

>leadership is a word "to describe significant actions enabling change that is welcomed by affected people. -- Bendell [-@bendell_leadership_2019]

- what kinds of significant actions?
- what might these 'changes' be?
- who are the ‘affected people’ in this context?
- who are the groups, networks or whole communities of people?
- what kinds of effects over time?

- possible to link leadership thoughts about 'affected people' below with 'crowd epistemics' from That Thing Produced? 






## sum requested

- 

## time

- 18 month project, commencing June 2021

## personnel

- 1 x 0.6 PI (Ellis)
- 1 x 0.5 RA (TBC) 
- 1 x research consultant (Lalitarāja?) 

## hybrid method

- Primarily a first person investigation:[^1st] to grapple with first person experiences in, through and around the body (my body) – to fully wrestle with the uncertainty and unsayable experiences that carve into our flesh
- creative practice-research fieldwork
- history, philosophy
- qualitative research through ethnographic conversations

1. practice-research _fieldwork_ through three distinct practices (all based on the premise that we understand through doing (Ingold here?):
    
    a) high resolution experiences through movement: what is unsayable? what is unknowable? what remains? Dance and choreographic practices are paradigmatic in this method, because "The body is both a question and an inaccessible answer ... [where] the unseen shimmers, the unheard whispers, the unfelt is caressed and we intuit the unknown."[^heath2011]

    b) solitary practice (leadership focused): one hour daily in solitude and silence - "doubts, or questions, or even just difficulties ... can only be found within--without distractions, without peer pressure, in solitude".[^deres2010] This component is speculative and unknown. It's a wildcard. 
    
    c) collecting practice called "unforgettable experiences": collecting hand-written notes/letters of others about memories of watching dance/performance. Key: analogue, experience of watching (v 'doing' in 'a' above)

2. literature and field review: analysis of past and present through published materials (RA is primarily responsible)

3. cross-disciplinary case studies/interviews: 
    + leadership/epistemics/uncertainty/humility/epistemic limits
    + how to identify these cases? Cases ought also to be current practitioners working with PaR -- who would these be? (who are the key figures in dance? (and perhaps beyond). 
    + Possibilities could be:
        + Bob and Lee
        + Henk Borgdorff
        + Michael Schwab
        + Carol Brown
        + Paul Magee
        + Wendell Berry
        + what about areas like nursing, or care-based practices? Go broader

- analysis of these various data? 
    + cataloguing of collected letters/responses (sorting into various kinds of works, responses, years, etc)
