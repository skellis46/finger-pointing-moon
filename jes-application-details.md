### Title of Proposed Research (150 xters)

Finger pointing moon: the limits of practice-research

### Start Date and Duration 

7 March 2022
18 months

### Objectives [up to 4000 chars] ###

_List the main objectives of the proposed research in order of priority_

The objectives of the proposed project should be listed in order of priority and should be those that the applicant would wish the Council to use as the basis for evaluation of work upon completion of any grant awarded.


### Summary [up to 4000 chars] 

>Describe the proposed research in simple terms in a way that could be publicised to a general audience. Note that this summary may be published on the AHRC's website in the event that a grant is awarded. You should also summarise how the research will be beneficial to users who are within and beyond the academic research community, and how you intend on engaging with them. Following the removal of the distinct Pathways to Impact attachment applicants will be expected to show how the research provides impact throughout the application, and especially within the Case for Support.

Note: This Summary will be published on publicly available sites should the project be funded. Please ensure confidential information is not included in this Summary.

The Council has a responsibility to promote the public awareness and understanding of its research areas. The purpose of the Summary is to help publicise the Council's research programme to:

- Opinion-formers and policy makers;
- The general public; and
- The wider research community.

The summary should be written in a style that is accessible to a variety of readers, including the general public. 

The summary may cover, for example:

- The principal subject of the research;
- The key aims;
- Where and how the research would be undertaken;
- Who else would be involved; and


### Ethical implications

AHRC - Specific Requirements

Please indicate whether there are any ethical implications arising from the proposed research activities.  For example, does the research involve human participants?  Does it require travel to countries where the safety of project participants might be in jeopardy? Could the research result in damage to the natural environment?  If the project involves public engagement in the research, has consideration been given to ensuring appropriate equality and diversity of engagement?

If there are ethical implications, you should give brief details of what they are and how you intend to address them.

You are also asked to indicate whether your HEI has a policy on good conduct in research, in line with the requirements of the Research Councils.

If the answer is Yes, please indicate where this can be accessed (e.g. website address).

### Academic Beneficiaries [4000 xters] ###

_Describe who will benefit from the research_

>The Academic Beneficiaries section asks you to summarise how your research will benefit other researchers in your field and – where relevant – academic beneficiaries in other disciplines. Academic communication and dissemination plans should be elaborated further in your Case for Support. Academic Beneficiaries is a section to complete within the proposal form. (p.58 guide)

Please summarise how your proposed research will contribute to knowledge, both within the UK and globally.

Academic Beneficiaries (4000 characters max) should address the following questions:

- How the research will benefit other researchers in the field
- Identify whether there are any academic beneficiaries in other disciplines and, if so, how they will benefit and what will be done to ensure that they benefit
- What other researchers, both within the UK and elsewhere are likely to be interested in or to benefit from the proposed research.

Please look broadly beyond narrow research field. UKRI recognises that in generating new knowledge, a cross-disciplinary or single-disciplinary approach may be the most appropriate. Applicants are asked to clearly state their chosen approach and provide justification for that choice.

List any academic beneficiaries from the research and give details of how they will benefit and how the results of the proposed research will be disseminated. Specific beneficiaries might be:

- Researchers in the investigator’s immediate professional circle, carrying out similar or related research
- Researchers in other disciplines
- Researchers in other academic institutions (in the UK and/or international)

Also describe the relevance of the research to beneficiaries:

- Identify the potential academic impact of the proposed work
- Show how the research will benefit other researchers (this might include methodological or theoretical advances)
- Identify whether the research will produce data or materials of benefit to other researchers, and explain how these will be stored, maintained and made available
- Explain any collaboration with other researchers and their role in the project

Note: The Academic Beneficiaries section may be published to demonstrate the impact of Research Council funded research.  Please ensure confidential information is not included in this section.


### Project partners

>If appropriate, the project may be delivered in collaboration with one or more non-academic partner organisations. Both UK and International organisations are eligible and must be existing organisations, although there is no minimum period stipulated for which they must have been operating. When collaborating with international partners you must demonstrate that the UK research is at the international leading edge. (p.59)


Project Partners

Details should be given of project partners and their contributions. An organisation should only be named as a project partner if it is providing specific contributions (either direct or indirect) to the research project.

Research Councils will pay Research Councils' % contribution of the total costs of the project excluding the project partner contribution. Project partner contributions in cash or in-kind should be seen as additional to the Research Councils' % contribution and are not considered part of the fEC of the project. BBSRC operates an exception for Industrial Partnership Awards (see BBSRC Research Grants Guide for details).

Attach a letter to the proposal (attachment type "letter of support") from each partner.

The content of the letter should:

- Confirm commitment to the proposed project;
- Clearly explain the value, relevance and possible benefits of the work to the project partner;
- Give the nature and equivalent value of any in-kind contribution, and/or declare the value of a cash contribution, and period of support; and
- Describe the added value to the project of the project partner’s involvement.

The letter should be dated and should be written when the proposal is being prepared. The letter should be targeted specifically to the project. A standard letter declaring support for the proposed work is not helpful.

Name of partner organisation: If the organisation is a wholly owned subsidiary, enter the parent company.

Division/Department: Enter if applicable.

Address Details: These will be automatically entered after selecting an organisation.
