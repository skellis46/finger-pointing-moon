>Many students I work with help themselves "let be" by mentally whispering an encouraging word or phrase. You might feel the grip of fear or the swelling of deep grief and whisper yes. You might say, "This too" or "It's okay."

>There are degrees of Allowing. At first, you may feel you're just going through the motions, "putting up" with unpleasant sensations. Or you may realize you've made a secret bargainâ€”"I'll say yes to shame, and it will magically disappear." Yet even simply whispering yes begins to give you a sense of more space, more room for what is there. Your entire being is not so rallied in resistance. As you continue to practice, your defenses will ease up. You may feel a physical sense of yielding or relaxing and opening to waves of experience.

>Our deeply grooved habits of "no,' our angry reactivity, anxious worry, defensiveness, addictive behavior, and self-blame, keep us from living true to ourselves. When we interrupt these habits with a mindful, allowing presence, we begin to access our full human potential. This is the power and freedom inherent in "yes."  [@brach_radical_2020 p.28]

>Saying yes is unfamiliar and disorienting and feels potentially risky. When we perceive a threat, our primal conditioning is to contract and say no. [@brach_radical_2020 p.20]

>The deepest transformations in our lives come down to something very simple: We learn to respond, not react, to what is going on inside us. [@brach_radical_2020 p.17]
