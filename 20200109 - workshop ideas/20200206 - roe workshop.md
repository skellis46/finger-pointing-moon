# 20200206 - roehampton workshop

1. Move slow and take care of things
2. all fours/hugging: yes, no (as judgement): whisper then loud
3. phones off: dark space, wild space for our analogue bodies
4. language: how many? 
5. question wall: any language: how many questions?
6. yes no post-its: boolean/digital, judgemental
7. small groups discussion (in any language) - not important if you are not understood
8. radical analogue-ness of human body
9. yes but not as judgement; yes as "and this, and this"

>Saying yes is unfamiliar and disorienting and feels potentially risky. When we perceive a threat, our primal conditioning is to contract and say no. [@brach_radical_2020 p.20]

>The deepest transformations in our lives come down to something very simple: We learn to respond, not react, to what is going on inside us. [@brach_radical_2020 p.17]

10. questions for wall

11. non-judgemental practice (5min rotations)
    + pairs
    + watcher: care, non-judgement, eyes only for that person (try not to be distracted by the rest of the room), thinking yes, and yes, and yes, slight smile is useful
    + doer: non-judgement: moving (or not). yes and yes. 
    + discussion: start with doer - describe the experience
12. poem (yes and yes)
13. non-judgemental practice (10min practice)
14. questions for wall
15. group discussion
16. silence
17. tidy


## move slow and take care of things 

Move fast and break things. 
Move slow and take care of things

- still wild space: untouched -- briefly by surveillance: my body.
- go dark

- yes and no as judgement
- post-its of yes and no
- saying yes or no to images or things
- discussion of yes and no
- judgement (with and without)
- this not that, that not this
- radical analogue-ness
- how to make things without judgement?

## preparing for ghosts

## privacy-fundamentalism

>Indeed, that is why my critique of [Manjoo’s article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/23/opinion/data-internet-privacy-tracking.html) specifically and the ongoing privacy hysteria broadly is not simply about definitions or philosophy. It’s about fundamental assumptions. The default state of the Internet is the endless propagation and collection of data: you have to do work to not collect data on one hand, or leave a data trail on the other. This is the exact opposite of how things work in the physical world: there data collection is an explicit positive action, and anonymity the default.

>You can compete with Big Tech. Big Tech is about quantity, noise, speed, cheap and meaningless. Human tech is about quality, depth, meaning and deep community.

>When you support free, you support billionaires. When you pay, you support sane businesses and real creators. Start paying for things that cost money. If you can’t afford to, use fewer things, which generally make you happier anyway.

- still wild spaces: "my body" (untracked, dark spaces: dark from surveillance)

- Formative v performative (from book “A time to build”)
- thinking of the movement practice as formative

- work in silence, and in whispers only. we don't know who or what is listening. 

what do you know-think about privacy, security and surveillance?
what might it have to do with dancing?


>For James as for von Helmholtz, this means that there is no such thing as voluntary sustained attention. Instead, what passes for sustained attention is actually a series of successive efforts to bring attention back to the same thing, considering it again and again with unwavering consistency. Furthermore, if attention attaches to what is new, we must be finding ever newer angles on the object of our sustained attention—no small task. James thus makes explicit the role of will in attention:

>>Though the spontaneous drift of thought is all the other way, the attention must be kept strained on that one object until at last it grows, so as to maintain itself before the kind with ease. This strain of attention is the fundamental act of will.20

>There are degrees of Allowing. At first, you may feel you're just going through the motions, "putting up" with unpleasant sensations. Or you may realize you've made a secret bargain—"I'll say yes to shame, and it will magically disappear." Yet even simply whispering yes begins to give you a sense of more space, more room for what is there. Your entire being is not so rallied in resistance. As you continue to practice, your defenses will ease up. You may feel a physical sense of yielding or relaxing and opening to waves of experience.

-- Tara Brach [@brach_radical_2020 p.26]


>Our deeply grooved habits of "no,' our angry reactivity, anxious worry, defensiveness, addictive behavior, and self-blame, keep us from living true to ourselves. When we interrupt these habits with a mindful, allowing presence, we begin to access our full human potential. This is the power and freedom inherent in "yes."  [@brach_radical_2020 p.28]
