#Â work plan

A Workplan attachment is required for all Leadership Fellows and Research, Development and Engagement Fellowship applications. It must be used to outline your timetable for the project (both research and leadership activities) and to indicate the work to be undertaken in each month of the award. The Work plan should clearly outline your time commitment for each phase of the Fellowship. The Work plan must not exceed one A4 page.
