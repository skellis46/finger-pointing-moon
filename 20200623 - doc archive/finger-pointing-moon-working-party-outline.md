# finger pointing moon

1. main idea:

When artist-scholars adopt practice-research methods it is _implied_ but rarely stated that these methods are best able to reveal change and difference in the artistic materials and experiences that underpin the research. _Finger Pointing Moon_ aims to address practice-research's fundamental, long-standing and most controversial epistemic question: What can we know or understand differently as a consequence of practice-research? 

2. funding scheme: AHRC leadership grant
