# seeking letter of support from project partners

subject line: finger pointing moon research project: information regarding letter of support

Dear 

This email is about the research project called _Finger Pointing Moon_ that XX agreed to partner in an email exchange last year (dated: ). I'm getting towards the end of the proposal preparation and so it's time to start working on a project partner letter of support. 

I've attached a two page PDF to help this preparation. The first page is a general summary of the "Research, Development and Engagement" fellowship I am proposing. The second page is a summary of the funder's expectations of a letter of support written by a project partner. 

Could you take a close look at the PDF and then get back to me with any questions you might have about preparing a letter of support (or even an initial draft)?

Would three weeks be enough time to do this -- say by xxx?

Thanks so much for your time and support, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Very best wishes

Simon


## _Finger Pointing Moon_: project summary

The professionalisation of the arts in the Academy over the last 30 years has led to the development and growth of a hybrid research approach called practice-research. This collection of methods is based on the traditional art-making strategies of artists, and attempts to honour the exploratory and ambiguous nature of these practices while addressing the scholarly conventions of traditional research. 

_Finger Pointing Moon_ is a research, development and engagement fellowship that explores how research conducted through artistic practice might broadly contribute to the ways knowledge is produced and valued in the Academy, and how that understanding is communicated productively to the wider public. 

The fellowship has a research component and a development component. The research component will address a fundamental and contested question in artistic practice-research: What is known or understood differently as a consequence of employing practice-research methods? The Principal Investigator and two other experts will use studio-based fieldwork -- specifically an experimental body-based movement practice called _authentic movement_ -- to develop an empirical approach to practice-research, and combine this with desk-based research to generate theoretical perspectives on the limits and role practice-research is able to play in the broader academic research ecosystem.

The research will benefit artist-scholars at all levels of experience across the arts and humanities by creating a relatively unambiguous examination of the claims that practice-researchers are able to make of their work specifically, and through artistic processes of experimentation more generally. We will engage these people working at the intersection of professional arts and the Academy through a number of processes, but most importantly via an openly accessible online Discourse forum[^disc] that will run throughout the project timeline and beyond.

The development component of the fellowship focuses on collaborating with project partners in the UK, Italy and Australia to explore diverse ways to engage and converse with non-academic audiences about the significance of grappling with questions of epistemology, and how arts practices might play a key role in these conversations. In other words, the question "How do we know that we know what we know?" is far more than an intellectual or academic problem, but rather has never been more vital in our post-truth filter-bubbled world in which the radically analogue sensations of the human body are at odds with the seemingly unstoppable datafication of experience.

The development component will benefit public stakeholders in the arts who are curious about the ways artistic-scholarly research extends into public discourse. These will be audiences and organisations identified with the support of project partners. The public exhibitions and podcast series are designed to nourish arts and 'arts-adjacent' audiences. These diverse audiences will be involved through a series of public engagement events developed with the project partners: online conversations, public discourse and experimental curational strategies that involve artists local to the project partners.  

Although the entire _Finger Pointing Moon_ fellowship addresses what appears to be a niche concern -- the epistemic limits of artistic practice-research -- the diverse outputs proposed in both the research and development components of the project will reveal how experiencing and understanding epistemic limits are a fundamental part of being human.

## Guide for preparing project partner letters of support

The following guidelines are from the Arts and Humanities Research Council.

- provide details of the project partner organisation  
- confirm your organisation's commitment to the proposed project  
- clearly explain the value, relevance and possible benefits of the work to the project partner  
- give the nature and equivalent value of any in-kind contribution, and/or declare the value of a cash contribution, and period of support  
- Describe the added value to the project of the project partnerâ€™s involvement. This is particularly important regarding public engagement. What strategies might we use to directly engage audiences (and how are they specifically relevant to the planned exhibition)? Who are those audiences?   
- two A4 pages maximum (11 point Arial)  
- The letter should be targeted specifically to the project.
